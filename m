Is there a reason not to use EMIFF as for the memory port for any DMA
activity between a peripheral and system (kernel) memory?

It looks to me like TIPB is the right port to use for anything except
camera and LCD?

If that's true, we can solve the memory side of the problem very easily -
we know that prep_slave_sg() will always souce from system memory, so
the port for that will be known.

For the peripheral side of the transfer, I think we should case this on
the request signal as the combinations seem to be very limited - and it
looks like this knowledge is specific to the DMA controller rather than
the peripheral.
