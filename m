It is OK at the moment.

It is only used in interrupt handlers which currently do run in interrupt
context with IRQF_DISABLED.  If both DMA and MMC interrupt handlers were
changed to be threaded interrupts, then the spin-lock would still be OK.
But if only one of them was changed, then the spin-lock would have to be
changed to be irq-safe.

It is not a problem.  It may mean the card does not initialize but if that
happens there will be lots more errors.
