Root cause for this issue is that the MMC IP is reset during off-mode,
but the driver doesn't expect this in its current form. There are a
couple of alternative ways to fix this. Either add a reset timeout to
the MMC driver code (which was removed by the bisected patch), or
alternatively add a global reset check to the hwmod code. I'll send a
patch for the global reset purpose in a bit for commenting.
