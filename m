I haven't seen it either, and I've been doing a lot of testing on the
ext4 test branch.  So I'm guessing Tony has the only reliable repro
for the problem at the moment.  That being said, it shouldn't be that
hard to create a test case for this and add it to xfstests.

I'm pretty sure Jan is right about this, though, but it would be great
to a get a quick confirmation from Tony if at all possible.
