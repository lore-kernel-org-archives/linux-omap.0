Yeah. Probably the best solution for cases like this is to boot with
a small initrd. That way you can get usb console and networking going
before mounting the real root and you will see kernel messages with
only minimal things built in. You can build a small initramfs with
CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE that is appended to the kernel so you can
also boot the legacy user space too with that if needed.
