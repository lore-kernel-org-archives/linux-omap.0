This is another resend with mmc_gpio_set_cd_isr() now returning
void and being EXPORTed.

I included
	WARN_ON(ctx->cd_gpio_isr);
to guard against misuse.

My goal is to get omap_hsmmc to use the common code for parsing of,
particularly so that I can set "cap-power-off-card", which omap_hsmmc
doesn't explicitly report.

Thanks,
NeilBrown

P.S. Sorry for delay - I've been travelling.
