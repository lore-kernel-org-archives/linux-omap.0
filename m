   I think these cases are already handled properly. All actions are
taken if, and only if, TC is received.
Once TC is received, the sequence of execution is unaltered by DMA
callback. Dma callback
is effectively a no-op after the final block is transmitted.

   We can in fact get rid of the timeout logic. Of course, the DMA
channel is cleared
once the TC is received, hence there would be no spurious DMA callbacks=
 during
the start of next transaction. [The only hanging case is when the TC
is never triggerred,
even after a successful transfer, but that's another issue altogether]

Regards,
Venkat.
