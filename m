Okay, then we agree. :-)

Pretty much, yes.  Unless the driver somehow knows that it will become
sufficiently idle at an early suspend stage (like the prepare callback)=
=20
that it doesn't need to use the PHY, GPIO, codec, etc.

Of course, this means that G must call dpm_move_last() _before_=20
registering its GPIOs.  So the overall flow of a probe routine is=20
simple enough:

	1. Check that all the resources you need are available.

	2. If not, defer your probe.  If yes, call dpm_move_last().

	3. Finish the probe, including registration of resources
	   that will be available to other drivers (such as child
	   devices).
