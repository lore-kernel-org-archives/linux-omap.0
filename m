Yes. I was able to bisect the number of interrupts to the same commit as
well.

On top of v4.14,

*Without revert*:
https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/VJgvzrCP9g/

avg speed for 100 MB transfer: 3.7 MBps
Number of interrupts per 100 MB transfer: ~2000

*After revert*:
https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/ktgTmKVKkN/

avg speed for 100 MB transfer: 4.6 MBps
Number of interrupts per 100 MB transfer: ~500

Also, I'm getting 1M buffers in the omap_hsmmc DMA now.

@Will will it be OK to change the mmc_segs back to 1024?

Thanks,
Faiz
