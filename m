The driver allocates a largish buffer for copying the input data from 
the sgs into a sequential space. If I don't save the contents of this 
buffer anywhere, the export/import doesn't work as expected it seems.

Actually I am now wondering why the driver allocates this sequential 
buffer at all, DMA should be possible to use over the sgs just fine, at 
least some other crypto drivers are doing this.
