However D sometimes does defer probes.  Therefore the device always
needs to be moved, even though this particular probe wasn't deferred.

But that's too early.  What if D gets moved to the end of the list,=20
then G gets added to the list and probed, and then D's probe succeeds?

And after the probe returns is too late, because by then there may well=
=20
be child devices.

Devices need to be moved whenever they have any external dependencies,
regardless of the particular order they get probed in.
