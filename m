Hi,

Since the 32KHz clock was removed from the twl-regulator (0e8e5c34
regulator: twl: Remove references to 32kHz clock from DT bindings),
we've been having problems with our wl12xx chip that is connected
through the omap_hsmmc.

Our card simply doesn't get added to the system and we get lots of
-ETIMEOUTs during mmc_attach.  If I revert 0e8e5c34 (plus a couple of
associated patches), everything works fine.

I've been using a Blaze device with a WiLink 1283 chip connected in the
COM (internal) port.  The funny thing is that I don't have the same
problem with a WiLink 1853 chip (which is connected externally to
another Blaze).

Does anyone know what the problem could and how to fix it?

This is a regression that has been there since 3.6-rc1.
