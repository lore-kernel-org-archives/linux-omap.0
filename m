Obvious statement knowing what's been going on elsewhere...

A while back, Olof produced a couple of patches to add /generic/ support
to deal with power and reset controls for SDIO WIFI cards.  Patches
were posted to linux-arm-kernel and other places around January time
this year.

No real conclusion came out of it, and it kind of died.  The point here
is that this is not an OMAP problem.  We have this very same problem
on different platforms and different SoCs.

Why should we have N different solutions to the same problem.  Why can't
we have one solution to fix this issue, rather than having every host
driver implement some different solution to what's a common problem.

If everyone is going to run away from generic problems and continue
inventing their own private solutions to generic problems, the kernel
is just going to become severely bloated and unmaintainable...

Please, sort out generic problems with generic solutions.
