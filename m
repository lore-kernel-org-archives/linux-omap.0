Looks like this somehow breaks detecting of eMMC on mmc2 for me at least
with the non-dt legacyboot. For a removable mmc1 still keeps working.

For mmc2 I have .nonremovable = true and no gpio_cd or gpio_wp.

Also few comments below.

This should be checked, we have systems with all muxing done statically
in the bootloader. And we also have systems that provide the default
pinctrl state only as they don't need remuxing. So at most a warning should
be printed.

The check for sdio_irq && host->pinctrl looks broken too as we may
have not dynamic muxing via pinctrl needed for let's say omap3 based
systems.

Other than that, looks good to me.
