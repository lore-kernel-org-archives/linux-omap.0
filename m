Sorry about a late reply, I was out on vacation.

For OMAP SHAM, this is actually needed, because the driver still has a 
very large internal buffer for performance reasons, and the whole buffer 
can't be exported. The flush functionality pushes out sufficient amount 
of data to the hardware, so that the rest of the buffer can be exported 
to the available space.

This is pretty much related to the discussion we had previously here:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9192881/

Basically I decided to keep the driver buffer the same size as 
previously, but flush out any extra data.
