IMO, it depends on what shape you plan to rework.  Currently, the
deferred probe may found a resource dependency, but I am not sure
that pm dependency is same with the resource dependency found
during probe.

Maybe we should understand the correct model of the ordering constraint=
s
for the multiple device dependancies first, could you give a descriptio=
n or
some examples about it?
