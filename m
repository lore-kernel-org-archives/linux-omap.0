Agreed, this solution is more complicated than it probably needs to be.

Ah, good point, I hadn't considered that.  I'll rework my
implementation to do that and resubmit.

Not sure why it wouldn't work on the 5910.  I tested it on my device,
and it works properly for me, but then I don't have an omap-based
device that uses 32-bit register definitions.  I'm confused at the
post you have above though...Is that with my patch, or is that with
something else?  It seems to reference the status of current git,
which I don't think this patch shouldn't be in.
