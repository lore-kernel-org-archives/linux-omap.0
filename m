New compatible sounds simpler to me since it allows to select a driver per-MMC
instance. (SDIO support is not added/validated in sdhci-omap).

To summarize, we'll create new compatible and new bindings for sdhci-omap and
start enabling sdhci-omap on per-board basis. When all the TI platforms starts
to use sdhci-omap, omap-hsmmc will be removed at which point support for old
compatible and old dt bindings will be added to sdhci-omap.c. Does this sound
reasonable?

Thanks
Kishon
