Can't we can just do this in drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:

- host->dev->dma_mask =3D &pdata->dma_mask;
+ host->dev->dma_mask =3D 0xffffffff;

And that way drop it from the platform data. Looks like some omap1
omap_mmc_platform_data don't have it set though, but we do have host->u=
se_dma =3D 1
set anyways in drivers/mmc/host/omap.c.
