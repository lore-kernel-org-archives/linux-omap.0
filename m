you might force a contention here - depending on System configuration.
example:
+-------+
|       |
|  U1   |         +------+      +-----------+
|       +--------->      |      |           |
+-------+         |      |      |           |
                  | Switch<-----+    SoC    |
+-------+         |      |      |           |
|       |         |      |      |           |
| U2    <---------+--^---+      +-----------+
|       |            |
|       |            |
+-------+            |
                  +--+--+
                  |     |
                  | PCF |
                  |     |
                  +-----+

At low, SoC pin is connected to U2 as drive. when reset to high, you
now have U1 driving to the same pin that SoC has, potentially
resulting in contention.


Unfortunately, at this level, you do not know what the state of the
system is, blindly forcing a pin level will potentially cause
contention risk depending on pin configuration.
