Hello,

Some MMC controller instances integrated on older OMAP34xx/35xx chips
don't work correctly with multiple-block reads, due to a hardware bug.
This series fixes the problem by adding an MMC capability flag for this
case and making the appropriate changes to the MMC core code and OMAP HSMMC
driver to support this.

Once this series is merged, a subsequent patch will be needed by us OMAP
folks to pass the appropriate device data via hwmod - this will be posted
separately.
