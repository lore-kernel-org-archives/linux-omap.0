Have you already merged this series in your for-next? I could see all the
patches except "ARM: dts: omap*: Replace deprecated "vmmc_aux" with "vqmmc" in
your for-next.

Do you want me to resend the entire series or only "ARM: dts: omap*: Replace
deprecated "vmmc_aux" with "vqmmc"?

Please note having vqmmc property is required when we move to sdhci driver.

Thanks
