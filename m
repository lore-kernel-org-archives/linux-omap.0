Probably not as then you don't need to export any custom functions
from the pbias code.

Yes exactly, that's what you can totally define with pinconf-single,bits
in omap3.dtsi and omap4.dtsi files. Then from the pbias handling regulator
code you just request named pinctrl states which are now the same
from pbias driver point of view.
