I understand, no problem.

Yes, please send them to me. I will give them a try and let you know the
results.

As a side node: actually I'm working double tracked. I plan to use it on
some OMAP-based board like Beagleboard or Pandaboard for a stationary
system, running any kernel that is needed.

But I'd like to use some spare N900s as well, because I can carry them
around easily. But these are running ancient 2.6.28.1 kernels. David
Vrabel mentioned that he originally developed his patches on the N900. I
sent him a mail using his mail address from csr.com, but I have not
received a reply yet.

If you or anybody else has every seen his original patches for the N900
(he did not sent them to any list as far as I know) please let me know
as well.
