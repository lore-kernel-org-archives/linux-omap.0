Thanks Herbert,

I just gave a trial for your branch, and seems to be working for me. 
Also checked the patches you applied and they seem fine also.

I have also a new version of the sha buffer handling and export/import 
available now, but need to cleanup it quite a bit, and figure out how to 
split the patch properly.

  drivers/crypto/omap-sham.c | 532 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++-------------------

... It now uses sg for xmitting data where possible, and avoids the need 
for a large internal buffer. The buffer size is also now properly 
configurable, which can be used to overcome the performance issues if 
needed (this however, requires the max statesize hack within the 
crypto/ahash.c file, but thats fine.) I'll hopefully post this out maybe 
tomorrow, but its going to be targeted for 4.10 I believe due to the 
(ahem, rather) intrusive changes.
