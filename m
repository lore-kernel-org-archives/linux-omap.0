So there is some external actual regulator supplying the voltage
and then that is looped back in to the pads. (I understand this is
quite a common construction.)

Anyway since it is obviously removing and applying voltage to
the pins, I think this is more of a cascaded regulator.
We use regulators for simple light-switches and things you know.

We have generic pinconf options for things like current but not
voltage really. It's because in the case of pin current configuration
it's basically about how many driver stages (totempoles) you connect
to the output, which is very different from the voltages we're dealing
with here.

So I think these bits go into a regulator driver:

This looks much more cascaded regulator control than
anything else to me.

I guess you mean this:

This seems to belong to the MMC host driver.

It is common that registers contain indiviual bits that end up in
different subsystems. Speed mode seems to belong in the MMC
driver.

The infrastructure used to spread out responsibility across different
drivers from a common register range or even for certain bits in a
certain register, is regmap. Check for example mfd/syscon.c.

This is actually pin config. But if it makes sense it should also be
part of the MMC regulator driver.

No I'm not saying you should use pinctrl as a "back-end" for this.
I mean you shall instantiate a regulator and let the callback ops
vtable for that regulator poke these bits.

I will respect Marks judgement on this for sure.

The regulator framework supports selector tables just
like this.

Where the register fields are located does not matter.

No. If we go down that road *anything* that is connected to a
pad becomes part of the pinctrl subsystem, then pinctrl-single
becomes some kind of hardware abstraction or BIOS, and that
is *not* the intent. It is only supposed to deal with the bits
there that are 100% related to what pinctrl does, nothing else.
