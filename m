These patches fix the following error message in dra7xx boards:

[4.833198] mmc1: Got data interrupt 0x00000002 even though no data
operation was in progress.

Tested with 100 times boot tests on dra71x-evm, dra72x-evm and
dra7xx-evm.

v4:
Fixed commit description for patch 1.
Added SDHCI_INT_TIMEOUT to CMD_ERR_MASK in patch 2.

v3:
Removed the command error specific callback and using the already
existing sdhci_irq callback instead. No measurable drop in performance.

v2:
Added EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL for sdhci_cmd_err and sdhci_send_command to fix
errors when built as module.

Faiz Abbas (2):
  mmc: sdhci: Export sdhci_finish_command()
  mmc: sdhci-omap: Don't finish_mrq() on a command error during tuning
