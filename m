As long as DMA driver can advertize its MAX SG limit, peripherals can
always work around that by limiting the number of sync events they
generate so as to not having any of the events getting missed. With this
series, I am worried that EDMA drivers is advertizing that it can handle
any length SG list while not taking care of missing any events while
doing so. This will break the assumptions that driver writers make.

But if MMC/SD driver knows how many events it should generate if it
knows the MAX SG limit. So there should not be any missed events in
current code. And I am not claiming that your solution is making matters
worse. But its not making it much better as well.

Agreed, I am not debating that we need to handle SG lists of any length.
The hardware is capable of handling them, and no reason kernel should not.

No. AFAIR, thats a ping-pong between internal RAM and DDR for earlier
audio ports which did not come with FIFO.

I was hinting at using the linking facility of EDMA to achieve this.
Each PaRAM set has full 32-bit source and destination pointers so I see
no reason why non-contiguous case cannot be handled.

Lets say you need to transfer SG[0..6] on channel C. Now, PaRAM sets are
typically 4 times the number of channels. In this case we use one DMA
PaRAM set and two Link PaRAM sets per channel. P0 is the DMA PaRAM set
and P1 and P2 are the Link sets.

Initial setup:

SG0 -> SG1 -> SG2 -> SG3 -> SG4 -> SG5 -> SG6 -> NULL
 ^      ^      ^
 |      |      |
P0  -> P1  -> P2  -> NULL

P[0..2].TCINTEN = 1, so get an interrupt after each SG element
completion. On each completion interrupt, hardware automatically copies
the linked PaRAM set into the DMA PaRAM set so after SG0 is transferred
out, the state of hardware is:

SG1  -> SG2 -> SG3 -> SG3 -> SG6 -> NULL
 ^       ^
 |       |
P0,1    P2  -> NULL
 |       ^
 |       |
 ---------

SG1 transfer has already started by the time the TC interrupt is
handled. As you can see P1 is now redundant and ready to be recycled. So
in the interrupt handler, software recycles P1. Thus:

SG1 -> SG2 -> SG3 -> SG4 -> SG5 -> SG6 -> NULL
 ^      ^      ^
 |      |      |
P0  -> P2  -> P1  -> NULL

Now, on next interrupt, P2 gets copied and thus can get recycled.
Hardware state:

SG2  -> SG3 -> SG4 -> SG5 -> SG6 -> NULL
 ^       ^
 |       |
P0,2    P1  -> NULL
 |       ^
 |       |
 ---------

As part of TC completion interrupt handling:

SG2 -> SG3 -> SG4 -> SG5 -> SG6 -> NULL
 ^      ^      ^
 |      |      |
P0  -> P1  -> P2  -> NULL

This goes on until the SG list in exhausted. If you use more PaRAM sets,
interrupt handler gets more time to recycle the PaRAM set. At no point
we touch P0 as it is always under active transfer. Thus the peripheral
is always kept busy.

Do you see any reason why such a mechanism cannot be implemented?

Thanks,
Sekhar
