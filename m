Okay, so this turns out to be really quite simple as the first step - as
below.  This makes us always use EMIFF for the memory side, and TIPB for
the peripherals, which won't be a problem until we start thinking about
camera and LCD.

I'm not going to conditionalise their use because they're merely ignored
by arch/arm/plat-omap/dma.c on non-OMAP1 targets, so having this driver
set them to zero for non-OMAP1 makes little sense (other than just making
things unnecessarily more complicated.)

So, with this patch plus my original patch to omap's mmc host driver, this
should result in something which works without all the overhead of drivers
supplying the port information.  Please confirm, and I'll merge this into
the original omap-dma.c commit.

Thanks.
