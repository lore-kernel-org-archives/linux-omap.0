Absolutely - we _really_ _really_ _really_ need to get MMC usable
on the 4430SDP for this merge window - don't care about the card
detection provided the system can find a MMC card which is left
plugged in.

To do this makes the overall 4430SDP more usable than it currently
is with mainline kernels.
