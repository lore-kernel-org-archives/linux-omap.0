Element sync vs Frame sync change seems to be fine thought it's
bit puzzling that why it was not that way first place.

The patch seems to be fine to me.

Am looping Shubro in case he has any comment on "why element sync was u=
sed ?"
and also to test the patch with more peripherals connected over SPI.
