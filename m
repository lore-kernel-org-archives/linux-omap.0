But it will not encounter null PaRAM set because McASP uses contiguous
buffers for transfer which are not scattered across physical memory.
This can be accomplished with an SG of size 1. For such SGs, this patch
series leaves it linked Dummy and does not link to Null set. Null set is
only used for SG lists that are > MAX_NR_SG in size such as those
created for example by MMC and Crypto.

Existing driver have to wait anyway if they hit MAX SG limit today. If
they don't want to wait, they would have allocated a contiguous block of
memory and DMA that in one stretch so they don't lose any events, and in
such cases we are not linking to Null.

But it is waiting anyway even today. Currently based on MAX segs, MMC
driver/subsystem will make SG list of size max_segs. Between these
sessions of creating such smaller SG-lists, if for some reason the MMC
controller is sending events, these will be lost anyway.

What will happen now with this patch series is we are simply accepting a
bigger list than this, and handling all the max_segs stuff within the
EDMA driver itself without outside world knowing. This is actually more
efficient as for long transfers, we are not going back and forth much
between the client and EDMA driver.

Do you mean ping-pong scheme as used in the davinci-pcm driver today?
This can be used only for buffers that are contiguous in memory, not
those that are scattered across memory.
