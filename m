These patches add support for SDIO cards to the omap_hsmmc driver.  Less
restrictions on the sizes of transfers, power management changes to 
prevent SDIO cards from being turned off and losing all state, and card
interrupts.

I've been unable to test these exact patches as I only have an N900 for 
testing and the N900 support in mainline is incomplete.

David Vrabel (3):
  mmc: omap_hsmmc: use packet sync'd DMA
  mmc: omap_hsmmc: don't turn SDIO cards off when idle
  mmc: omap_hsmmc: enable SDIO card interrupts
