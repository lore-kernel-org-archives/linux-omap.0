Yeah, that u-boot version is just unusable at all with any mainline
kernel, since we are still missing pads conf for every drivers.

Regarding the 32k clock, I noticed as well that the OMAP4460 panda
u-boot is the only one to enable it at boot time, and thus this is the
only board that can probe the wilink chip properly as of today.
