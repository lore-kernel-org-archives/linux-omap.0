omap3-overo-base.dtsi has the following dt node for mmc.
/* optional on board WiFi */
&mmc2 {
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        pinctrl-0 = <&mmc2_pins>;
        vmmc-supply = <&w3cbw003c_npoweron>;
        vqmmc-supply = <&w3cbw003c_bt_nreset>;
        vmmc_aux-supply = <&w3cbw003c_wifi_nreset>;
        bus-width = <4>;
        cap-sdio-irq;
        non-removable;
};

It has both "vqmmc-supply" and "vmmc_aux-supply". However omap-hsmmc driver has
never parsed vqmmc so far. So I'd assume bt was never functional and it's used
only for wifi.

So for the change suggested by Ulf, Can I do something like below, so that we
can keep wifi functional (ignoring bt since that was never functional)?
-       vqmmc-supply = <&w3cbw003c_bt_nreset>;
-       vmmc_aux-supply = <&w3cbw003c_wifi_nreset>;
+       vqmmc-supply = <&w3cbw003c_wifi_nreset>;

Thanks
Kishon
