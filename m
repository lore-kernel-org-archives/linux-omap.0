NAK.  This is really not "generic" because the whole point of this is
that it encapsulates architecture specific knowledge - in the case of
ARM, the fact that bit 1 is used to indicate whether the code is to be
run in Thumb mode or ARM mode.

That clearly does not belong in an asm-generic version of this.

I'm not saying "don't provide an asm-generic" version, I'm saying don't
use the ARM version as an asm-generic implementation, because it is
nothing of the sort.
