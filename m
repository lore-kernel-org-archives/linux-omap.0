Hmm I think my patch would end up looking pretty much like Martin's
patch after fixing the comments. Based on what I understood, Ulf
wants to keep pwrseq_simple, well, simple as discussed in [0].

It also seems Ulf also wants to leave out the allocation, and does
want to add any deeper knowledge of the state of the GPIOs in
pwrse-simple. Instead, we can do device specific pwrseq for things
like Marvell 8787 and so on.

Ulf may have more comments, but $subject patch fixes the issue
I'm seeing with wl12xx on omap5 devices:

Probably should be tagged Cc: stable # v4.4 when applied.

Regards,

Tony
