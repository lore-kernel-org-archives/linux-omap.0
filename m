Sorry for the late response here, but this is about 1.6% decrease. I
tried out the same commands on a dra7xx board here (with about 5
consecutive dd of 1GB) and the average decrease was 0.3%. I believe you
will also find a lesser percentage change if you average over multiple
dd commands.

Is this really so significant that we have to maintain two different
bottom halves and keep having difficulty with adding APIs that can sleep?

Also I am not sure how to implement only the error handling part in the
threaded_irq. We need to enter sdhci_request_done() and get the current
mrq before we can check for error conditions like I've done in patch 2:

/* Terminate and synchronize dma in case of an error */
if (data && (mrq->cmd->error || data->error) &&
    host->use_external_dma) {
	struct dma_chan *chan = sdhci_external_dma_channel(host, data);
	dmaengine_terminate_sync(chan);
}

On a related note, do we really need to protect everything in
sdhci_request_done() with spinlocks? In patch 2 I have only removed lock
for the terminate_sync() parts that I added but the whole
dma_unmap/dma_sync parts should be left unprotected IMO.

Thanks,
Faiz
