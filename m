No changes to the patches itself.

Only the dependency on some omap-gpio enable_irq/disable_irq patch
has been removed.

While developing, I was struck by a bug with disable_irq. After reviewing
the disable_irq code path, I thought the interrrupt got never disabled
for omap.  After fixing the bug I was hunting, which was completely
unrelated to disable_irq, I never verified if the dependency was really
needed.

While trying to upstream my disable_irq fixes for gpio-omap, I realized,
that disable_irq was always working for gpio-omap through the generic
lazy disable mechanism.

/**
 *      irq_disable - disable interrupt generation
 *      @desc:  irq descriptor which should be disabled
 *
 *      If the chip does not implement the irq_disable callback, we
 *      use a lazy disable approach. That means we mark the interrupt
 *      disabled, but leave the hardware unmasked. If an interrupt
 *      happens, then the interrupt flow handler masks the line at the
 *      hardware level and marks it pending.
 */
void irq_disable(struct irq_desc *desc)
{
        irq_state_set_disabled(desc);
        if (desc->irq_data.chip->irq_disable) {
                desc->irq_data.chip->irq_disable(&desc->irq_data);
                irq_state_set_masked(desc);
        }
}

The 4+ weeks testing mentionned in the 1st patch, was done with a
dedicated irq_disable hook in gpio-omap. I'm positive that it is not
needed at all, still the test was repeated for 1 day without that hook.

Andreas Fenkart (3):
  mmc: omap_hsmmc: Enable SDIO IRQ using a GPIO in idle mode.
  mmc: omap_hsmmc: debugfs entries for GPIO mode.
  mmc: omap_hsmmc: add PSTATE to debugfs regs_show.
