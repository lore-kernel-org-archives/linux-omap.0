max_segs= 64  looks like a sensible value to me for edma/sdma, with each 
param set ~40Bytes - this will ensure to fit in a single page.
IIRC, edma splits the list at 20. MAX_NR_SEGS set to 20 in edma.c. So, 
having a bigger number *may not* guarantee a proportional increase
in throughput.

When using ADMA, since you allocate the table only once during probe, 
there'll be no alloc calls at a later time.
And increase in number of sg entries would increase efficiency. I've 
seen  as many as 290-300 sg entries being used during file-system 
init/mount. So, for ADMA, I would say at least max_segs = 512 is a 
better option since descriptor size is 8B,
would still fit in a page.
You can over-wirte it under  "if (host->adma)"
