Hi,

Is the integration code in arch/arm/*omap* set to enable wakeup on the 
DAT1 ball on the OMAP?  I don't see any trace of that in the code.  That 
would surely prevent wakeup from succeeding on an off-mode enabled kernel.  
Sounds like there may be other problems.  Why not give it a try with an 
SDIO card and see if you can get it to work?

Hopefully someone inside TI is validating SDIO wakeup on Linux?

There appear to be least seven SDIO card drivers in 2.6.34-rc7. At least 
one of these is for a TI chip - the wl1251.  I think some of the 
Gumstix Overo OMAP3 boards are using an SDIO-connected Marvell Libertas:

David is probably testing with a Bluetooth card - maybe he can comment 
further.

Could you clarify?
