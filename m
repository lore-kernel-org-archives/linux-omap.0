Ok I was going to ask where you found that but I just rechecked the TRM=
 and
there it is in plain site:

When this bit is set to 1, the host controller automatically disables a=
ll
the input buffers except the buffer of mmci_dat[1] outside of a transac=
tion
in order to detect asynchronous card interrupt on mmci_dat[1] line and
minimize the leakage current of the buffers.

In my defence, I did search the TRM for every occurance of dat1 but not
dat[1].=A0 Oh well live and learn and forget and repeat.

John

So, Does the SDIO card interrupt mode work fine now?

Regards,
Madhu
