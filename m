FYI, the MMC on omap4 is not quite there yet at least
on my board. It mostly detects the card with
omap_4430sdp_defconfig, but fails always unless
CONFIG_RTC_DRV_TWL92330=y.. This is without CONFIG_SMP
as it oopses.

Also MMC is never detected with omap3_defconfig.

Santosh & Kishore, maybe take a look at that, otherwise
it looks like we still don't have a very usable support
for omap4.

I've piled all these patches into linux-omap master branch
for easy testing. Let me know if I missed some patch.

Regards,

Tony
