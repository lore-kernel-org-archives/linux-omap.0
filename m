If I understood correctly, you want to change all the
board files supporting the wl12xx wifi chip to have this
capability set, right?
Isn't this immediately affects the power consumption in
sleep state?
Shouldn't this be runtime controllable?
I bet there are many applications that do not care about WoW,
but do care about the power consumption.
How does this change affect them?
