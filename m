Hi Tony,

That was my first approach in fact, I sent this patch:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1198401/

But then was told by Kevin Hilman that the right solution was to do
the select on the drives to fix not only omap2plus_defconfig but any
config.
So I sent this patch and Santosh agrees with Kevin.

I don't really know the hardware nor the driver well enough to have a
strong position on this.

Best regards,
Javier
