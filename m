Hi,

earlier ti,non-removable was used for all eMMC and SDIO card, now it will
be used only for eMMC with always on vccq and configurable vcc.

vccq and vcc are supply names of eMMC part

Because this file makes a reference to mmc.txt and the core properties described
by mmc.txt are not added in ti-omap-hsmmc.txt

When ti,non-removable was added, Only OMAP platform that had eMMC was that on OMAP4
where power to eMMC cannot be switched off without sending CMD5 sleep command,
so no_regulator_off_init was needed to get it detected during boot.

Now start using generic non-removable for all removable cards which do not
have such limitation.
