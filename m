Is this with 3.8 final, or mmc-next?

Ah, I think you need this patch from mmc-next:

30bedc8b4c99b0da585a8e983d6346773cb50794
mmc: core: expose RPMB partition only for CMD23 capable hosts

It's already got a stable@ tag on it.  I'll be sending mmc-next to Linus
shortly and will make sure it gets into 3.8-stable; sorry it didn't make
it into 3.8-final.

- Chris.
