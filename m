Is it safe to queue this via mmc tree for 4.14 or is there a
dependency I must consider? The above didn't quite tell me that, could
you please elaborate.

Lots of sdhci drivers calls mmc_of_parse(), and uses the mmc slot gpio
APIs, so I don't this this is correct statement.

Is it really that much different? It would be nice if some really took
on the challenge of converting omap_hsmmc into an sdhci variant.

Especially by looking at the number new lines added in this series, I
am starting to think that we have reached this point. That in
conjunction with that sdhci is maintained and well supported,
comparing to what the omap_hsmmc driver seems to be.
