yes, SIM pbias bit mapping are similar to MMC.
I will try to add sim pbias to my next version.

This regulator driver will only control bits related to voltage settings
and is not touching other bits by using masks.

yes, It can be easily done for SIM pbias control.

PBIAS interrupts were never used in non-dt case, so did not consider
while adapting for DT. However it can be added later on.
