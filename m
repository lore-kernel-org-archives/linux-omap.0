Do these devices ever require deferred probes?

I don't think the second part needs to be quite so invasive. =20
Certainly drivers that never defer probes shouldn't require anything to
be moved.

A deferred probe _should_ move the device to the end of the list.  But
this needs to happen in the probe routine itself (after it has verified
that all the other required devices are present and before it has
registered any children) to prevent races.  It can't be done in a
central location.
