This is precisely the kind of crap I'm objecting to.  New kernel versions
come along, and things break because people add extra Kconfig symbols that
previous versions did not rely upon - and there's no communication of
what's required for new kernel versions.

This stuff needs documenting, so that people are aware what changes they
need to make - please put something in Documentation/arm/OMAP which
tracks what new additions are required to the Kconfig to keep things
working.
