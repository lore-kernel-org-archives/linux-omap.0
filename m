This is because doing discards right away is not always a win from
performance reasons.  There are some flash devices where discards are
super-slow and some devices where issuing discards too quickly would
cause them to trigger internal FTL race conditions and turn them into
paperweights.

There was at least one engineer from a Linux distribution who argued
for making discard not the default because back then, there were a lot
of SSD's floating out there (by a manufacturer who thankfully has
since gone bankrupt :-) for which they didn't want to deal with the
support requests from people who were angry about lost data or
destroyed SSD's --- because guess who they would blame?

Also, please note that for many devices it's much better to
periodically run fstrim (once a day or once a week) out of cron.

If someone wants to do a survey of available hardware and demonstrate:

   * there is significant value from enabling -o discard by default
     (instead of using fstrim)

   * there are no (or at least very, very few) devices for which
     enabling -o discard results in a major performance regression,
     and

   * if there are any devices left that turn into paperweights, they can
     be managed using blacklists,

I'm certainly open to changing the default.  There was, however, a
really good *reason* why the default was chosen to be the way it is.
