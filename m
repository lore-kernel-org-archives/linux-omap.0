No actually I think I wasn't very descriptive in my post. There is no
problem here. Whether it comes from DT or not, it works in both cases . (I
haven't tried adding interrupt node to dts but what I gathered from
Vaibhav's post is that it works also when added to dts)

But I can revisit Vaibhav's suggestion of adding it to dts for completeness
sake. My tree currently works and picks up the interrupt info from hwmod. I
just didn't see any activity on this thread for a while so I thought of
enquiring it was ok to pull it in for the 3.11 merge window or if the
consensus was that interrupt node be added to dts even though it works
without it.

Thanks,

-Joel
