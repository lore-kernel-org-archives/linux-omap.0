Great :) Beagle xm is a good one to test the USB PHY stuff on
and also MMC. Having USB cable connected or EHCI loaded blocks the PM
though, so NFSroot is not very usable for testing on it.

If you want to test PM over NFSroot, boards with the smsc911x known
to work with PM  are at least omap3-evm-37xx.dts and
logicpd-torpedo-37xx-devkit.dts.  Since you tinker with the USB PHYs,
torpedo has MUSB working the same way as the beagle boards, EVM I
think can be modified that way but by default has diffent PHY.

Also overo tobi boards work with PM but only for retntion idle and
not off idle, and map3-sbc-t3517.dts probably can be made to work
with PM but I have mine as a gateway and have not been able to test
with it.

Probably also zoom3 boards with later processor boards can be made
to work, the LDP has early omap34xx variants and can't be made to
work reliably.

I don't have omap3-lilly, but I'd assume that can also be made
to work with PM if not already working.

Thanks!
