Depends on the definition of essential.
Serial and mmc works.
I said it was an easter egg since it was... well... quite a bit of surp=
rise
that the same kernel started to fail for example in all audio operation=
 when I
updated the u-boot, which I tend to do every now and then to see if the=
re are
no regression.

So it was a nice surprise. Even the commit message agreed that it is go=
ing to
break the drivers:

    Note that this is going to break the kernel drivers. But this
    is the only way to get things fixed in the kernel.

Usually if I know I will going to break something intentionally I tend =
to send
warnings and give some grace periods for the interested guys to adopt.

And this is why people are not testing u-boot. We tend to have one work=
ing
binary moving from SD card to other and update it only, __only__ when i=
t can
not be avoided.

If we work together, we should work together...

Do not take it personal. I just had tough days...
