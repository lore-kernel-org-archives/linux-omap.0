This is the case with host/mmci.c.

It is taking a clock inside the driver (MCLK), but since it's an AMBA
primecell, you can see that when it's probed it also requests and
optional IP clock in drivers/amba/bus.c.

The ARM reference platforms are wired with two different clocks
connected to each of these.

There are platforms, such as the U300 that just connect the two
into one terminal though. To get a chance to handle the abstraction
for both cases these two clocks refer to the same struct clk in the
clock tree.

Aha I get it. So it uses the freq shift from the existing clock gate
code to hint rpm, that's actually how I envisioned that this would
work for this case.

Now I really started liking this patch.

Time will tell I guess, the code in each driver will surely be similar
to the above, but I already see some deviations, e.g. some HW
will need to delay the actual action taken, some may want to
manipulate a register or regulator etc, so I'd leave it open-ended
like this.
