Hi Chris, Chase,

Sorry for the late comment on this; I just noticed this thread.

I don't think this is the right fix.  Steve Sakoman and I discussed this a 
few months ago -- we did some debugging and Steve observed the timeouts on 
multiple block writes (0x19):

hsmmc: command 00000019
hsmmc: orig_rate = 96000000, div = 2, dto = 11
hsmmc: using 300000000 ns DTO
hsmmc: command 0000000d
mmcblk0: error -110 transferring data, sector 15257840, nr 96, card status 0xc00

So dto = 11 @ 48MHz is a 350ms timeout ((2^(11+13)) / 48000000).

I don't have an SD bus analyzer, but it looks to me think there are some 
SD cards that are not completing the write within the allotted time 
window.  It should be 250ms according to this SD spec:

https://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/pls/simplified_specs/Part_1_Physical_Layer_Simplified_Specification_Ver_3.01_Final_100518.pdf

The spec also says "It is strongly recommended for hosts to implement more 
than 500ms timeout value even if the card indicates the 250ms maximum busy 
length."

So to me, this should probably be solved in the generic Linux MMC layer.  
mmc_set_data_timeout() should presumably be using a huge timeout on 
writes.  Don't know what it should be but the current 300ms goal is 
arbitrary anyway - see commit 493890e75d98810a3470b4aae23be628ee5e9667 
("mmc: increase SD write timeout for crappy cards").

Otherwise, if we just change the OMAP host controller driver, we could run 
into the same problem on other controllers.  While this issue could be an 
OMAP specific problem, at the moment I don't see any obvious evidence of 
that.

So perhaps something like the following patch instead?  Unfortunately, I 
don't have one of these crappy SD cards as far as I know, so I can't 
really test it.

Subject: [PATCH] mmc: use really long write timeout to deal with crappy cards

Several people have noticed that crappy SD cards take much longer to
complete multiple block writes than the 300ms that Linux specifies.
Try to work around this by using a three second write timeout instead.
