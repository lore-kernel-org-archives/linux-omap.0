I agree. However, right now there's a dev_dbg() which checks for the return code.
I could change the host->pdata->resume() and host->pdata->suspend() to not return
anything if that's acceptable.

More importantly, is this the right fix or does the driver need some other fix
to make sure that such suspend failures do not occur at all?
