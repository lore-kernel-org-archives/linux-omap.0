Hey all,

I've been playing with the latest Linus tree kernel trying to get MMC
working on my device (an HTC Herald), and I've come up against a
problem.

In the function mmc_omap_start_request in drivers/mmc/host/omap.c, line
1160, I'm finding that this bug:

    BUG_ON(irqs_disabled());

is triggering shortly after the MMC initializes on boot.  I hadn't had
this problem before, but it's been a while since I've worked with this,
and I don't know what could have changed to cause this.  If I comment
out that line, everything seems to run fine -- the mmc card comes up,
and I can boot from it perfectly.

I'm sure commenting it out isn't the right solution, but I don't know
the MMC subsystem well enough to understand why that function is called
while interrupts are disabled.

Can anyone point me in a direction that might allow me to resolve this?
Has anyone else had this problem recently?

For reference, this is on an HTC Herald (OMAP850-based OMAP1).

Thanks
Cory
