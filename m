Just to be clear, my post was in response to the reported problems
with enabling sdio irqs with this patch:
http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/69122/

The patch originator reported good results but others reported
complete failure.  My hack fixed the problem for me.  I believe this
much more modest patch will also fix the problem but it is untested
because I don't have a board running right now.  Beware, I'm sending
this from gmail so it may get line wrapped but it is a trivial patch
so I think it is understandable.
