OK thanks makes sense.

Well the clocking issue should be already handled by the
runtime PM, otherwise we have a bug somewhere. I'm almost
certain that no special handling is needed for register
access beyond runtime PM, but it would probably be best
if you could test it.

Yes, let's merge the necessary tweaks to this patch before
applying. The SDIO interrupt should work during runtime
for all omaps, so maybe we should just ensure that runtime
PM keeps those omaps from going to deeper idle modes for
now.
