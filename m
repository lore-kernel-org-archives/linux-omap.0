I don't have any specific affinity to this number, but when requests
are bursty, they arrive
within a few 10s of ms within each other. Didn't want to have the
context/save restore
penalty associated with every request.

There is no direct relationship to the use case. Block layer buffers
and reworks the order
of requests and they are usually queued together. Having no context
save / restore
penalty for each request is definitely desirable.
(As I understand, MMC can lose context independent of MPU on OMAP4).
