Patch series implements voltage switching and tuning for omap_hsmmc
driver.

Changes from v1:
*) rebased on top of [1]
*) Patch breaking omap3 beagle xm is fixed. (set clk rate patch was
   breaking beagle xm)

[1] -> https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/8/21/125

Did basic read/write test in J6, J6 Eco, Beagle-x15, AM437x EVM,
Beaglebone black, OMAP5 uEVM and OMAP4 PANDA, OMAP3 beagle xm.
Also performed PM suspend/resume test with OMAP3 beagle xm.

Balaji T K (2):
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: add voltage switch support for UHS SD card
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: add tuning support

Kishon Vijay Abraham I (8):
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: Support vmmc_aux to switch to 1.8v
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: separate setting voltage capabilities from bus
    power
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: program HCTL based on signal_voltage set by
    mmc core
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: set clk rate to the max frequency
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: set timing in the UHSMS field
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: Workaround for errata id i802
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: Allow io voltage switch even for fixed vdd
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: remove incorrect voltage switch sequence

Mugunthan V N (1):
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: add software timer when timeout greater than
    hardware capablility
