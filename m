These patches add support for SDIO cards to the omap_hsmmc driver.
Power management changes to prevent SDIO cards from being turned off
and losing all state, and card interrupts.

I've been unable to test these exact patches as I only have an N900 for 
testing and the N900 support in mainline is incomplete.

Changes since v1:
- (hopefully) get all cards working again by removing a second call to
  read MMCi_STAT in the interrupt handler.
- flush posted writes after enabling/disabling SDIO interrupts.
- tweak the FIXME commit on disabling FCLK to better match what really
  going on (at least I think so anyway).

David Vrabel (2):
  mmc: omap_hsmmc: don't turn SDIO cards off when idle
  mmc: omap_hsmmc: enable SDIO card interrupts
