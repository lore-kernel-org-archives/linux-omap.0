We're nearing the merge window, and this is a regression that is yet
to be solved.  It causes a kernel warning with backtrace, so it's
very annoying.

The error is:

omap-dma-engine 4a056000.dma-controller: DMA-API: mapping sg segment longer than device claims to support [len=69632] [max=65536]

which indicates that we have a SG segment length that exceeds thte
published maximum segment size for a device - in this case the
DMA engine device.  The maximum segment size for the DMA engine comes
from the default per-device setting, in linux/dma-mapping.h, which is
64K.

However, omap_hsmmc sets:

        mmc->max_blk_size = 512;       /* Block Length at max can be 1024 */
        mmc->max_blk_count = 0xFFFF;    /* No. of Blocks is 16 bits */
        mmc->max_req_size = mmc->max_blk_size * mmc->max_blk_count;
        mmc->max_seg_size = mmc->max_req_size;

which ends up telling the block layer that we support a maximum segment
size of 65535*512, so of course it _will_ pass SG lists where a segment
is longer than 64K.

The problem here is that the HSMMC driver doesn't take account of the
DMA engine device's capabilities.

We have something of an odd situation in that the omap-dma device's
maximum SG size depends on the "address width" - it's 64K transfers
of whatever unit "address width" is, so the current implementation of
per-device parameters doesn't exactly work.  That means the default
64K limit at the device-level is reasonable.

The only thing I can think of doing is adding into omap_hsmmc:

	mmc->max_seg_size = min(mmc->max_req_size,
				min(dma_get_max_seg_size(host->rx_chan->device->dev),
				    dma_get_max_seg_size(host->tx_chan->device->dev)));

to limit the maximum segment size to that of the device _and_ dma
engine's capabilities.

Doing this solves the problem for me.
