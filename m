It's not relevant for this merge window, but I'm exploring some future
changes to our PM core code and have a question about how MMC works for
system suspend.

Basially, the question is: can the driver be reworked such that a system
suspend does not need to runtime resume the device?  For most devices,
we kind of expect that if the device is runtime suspended, a system
suspend will have nothing extra to do, but this driver runtime resumes
the device during system suspend in order to do "stuff", which I
admitedly don't fully undestand.

Ideally, the "stuff" needed for runtime suspend and system suspend could
be made to be common such that a system suspend of a runtime suspended
device would be a noop.

Is this possible?
