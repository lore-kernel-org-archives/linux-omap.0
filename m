The fclk  must be running when you end up here.
- sdio_irq_thread calls mmc_claim_host which calls pm_runtime_get in turn.
- upper level drivers (e.g. wifi) call mmc_claim_host before interacting with
  the host.
- in interrupt context, fclk must be on otherwise irq detection wouldn't work.

FYI:
In a previous patch for am335x with swakeup line missing, this function was
called from gpio irq context directly. There it could have happened that the
fclk was not running and your register accesses caused a SIGBUS.
With this version of the patch the gpio irg handler only wakes up the the host
with pm_request_resume. Actual sdio irq processing is done in a 2nd interrupt
triggered by mmc host itself. This models the behaviour, when your chip has
the swakeup line.
Assuming SDIO irq while in pm_suspend is rare followed by burst of SDIO
irqs. Then the additional delay of the 2nd interrupt would vanish in
the measuring
noise. Hence I chose this solution because it's simpler and less error prone.
