Hi Sekhar,

Considering you agree with my understanding of the approach you proposed,

I worked on some code to quickly try the different approach (ping-pong)
between sets, here is a hack patch:

https://github.com/joelagnel/linux-kernel/commits/dma/edma-no-sg-limits-interleaved

As I suspected it also has problems with missing interrupts, coming back
to my other point about getting errors if ISR doesn't get enough time to
setup for the next transfer. If you'd use < 5 MAX_NR slots you start
seeing EDMA errors.

For > 5 slots, I don't see errors, but there is stalling because of
missed interrupts.

I observe that for an SG-list of size 10, it takes atleast 7 ms before
the interrupt handlers (ISR) gets a chance to execute. This I feel is
quite long, what is your opinion about this?

Describing my approach here:

If MAX slots is 10 for example, we split it into 2 cyclically linked
sets of size 5 each. Interrupts are setup to trigger for every 5 PaRAM
set transfers. After the first 5 transfer, the ISR recycles them for the
next 5 entries in the SG-list. This happens in parallel/simultaneously
as the second set of 5 are being transferred.

Thanks,

-Joel
