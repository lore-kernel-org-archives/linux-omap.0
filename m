There was some discussion of this in the previous patch round before the
code was changed - it does end up adding an externally visible error
code but it doesn't really make any difference, especially if we don't
propagate it externally.  We've already got some other codes in a
similar style, though I can't remember the examples that were quoted
offhand.  Adding the new code avoids confusion about exactly what the
intent of the driver is.
