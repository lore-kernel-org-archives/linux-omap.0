Have you measured the context save/restore penalty when only the clocks
are gated (and no regulators involved) ?

In the current code, it's understandable why there were large latencies
that were avoided because the regulators were also cut.  With only the
clocks being cut, the latency involved will be significantly less.

Desirable for what?

What is implied in that statement is desirable for performance.

What if a different user would prefer the power savings gained by more
aggressively cuttting clocks over the performance gains of leaving
clocks enabled?
