I don't understand your concern here, could you explain

The IRQ is level triggered, so can't be lost. I implemented it as
suggested and surprisingly performance is pretty good. Actually not
worse than keeping the fclk enabled all times.

module: 88W8787 / mwifiex
tx bitrate: 150.0 MBit/s MCS 7 40Mhz short GI

                   |   tcp tx         |  signal  | cpu idle
---------------------------------------------------------------
keep fclk enabled  |   50.3 Mbits/sec | -23 dBm  | 15 %
suspend/resume     |   49.7 Mbits/sec | -22 dBM  | 13 %

patch follows
