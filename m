This is strange. Ideally after the dma cb is received the transfer comp=
lete
interrupt should fire.

Your first patch would break a corner erroneous case the driver is alre=
ady
handling. A scenario where TC was received before DMA cb came. There is
timeout logic in the driver which handles this case to let the request
succeed if a dma cb was received after a while otherwise err out. See t=
he
function omap_hsmmc_start_dma_transfer.

Is there a way to keep both the cases handled? If not we have to make
changes based on which of these scenario is very odd.
