S2 is PM_SUSPEND_STANDBY and S3 is PM_SUSPEND_MEM, at least that how I
read it. I would rather we update to PSCI 1.0 (at least) to properly
support SYSTEM_SUSPEND rather than retrofitting a system-wide suspend
state into CPU_SUSPEND since that seems wrong.

Obviously not in tree, since fncpy() is not available on ARM64, here is
what it looks like for ARM & MIPS systems though:

You have made your point and it is very valid, still that does not mean
fncpy() does not have any usefulness on ARM64 systems, this was one
although not "ARM approved" use case (system suspend), but use case
where you have code that should execute from SRAM is something that
should be possible using the standard facilities offered in
drives/misc/sram*.c
