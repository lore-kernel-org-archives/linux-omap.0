I don't get your point here. This patch is an optimization, and the 
driver works fine without it.

Typically yes, but I think there might be a race condition here if the 
driver is removed during operation. Anyway, I'll drop this patch and 
change the optimization to use autosuspend as Dave suggested; that gives 
almost the same performance boost as this one (I miss a couple of 
percent in the overall performance, but I can live with that.)
