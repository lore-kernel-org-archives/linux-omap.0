Kevin and I just chatted a little bit about this.  It seems best to=20
separate the work done on the autosuspend timeout from the runtime PM=20
conversion. =20

So how about this: please send a new version of these patches with the=20
previous value, 100ms, for the autosuspend timeout.  That should hopefully=
=20
minimize the behavior change here for existing users.  And hopefully we'll=
=20
be able to get the series in for this merge window.

Then later, we need to come back to this autosuspend timeout issue.
