Yeah.  I didn't merge them because Tony still has unanswered comments on
the OMAP side of the patches, and they're submitted as a single patchset.

I've applied {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12} to mmc-next for 3.1 now.  1 doesn't
apply because the function doesn't exist anymore.  4 doesn't apply
because iclk doesn't exist anymore.

If someone wants to look at rebasing the rest of these against mmc-next
and resubmitting, I think that'd be useful.

Thanks,

- Chris.
