This patch series does the following
*) Uses devm_regulator_get_optional() for vmmc and then removes the
   CONFIG_REGULATOR check altogether.
*) return on -EPROBE_DEFER and any other fatal errors
*) enable/disable vmmc_aux regulator based on prior state

Changes from v2:
*) rebased to mmc -next branch
*) dropped using "mmc_of_parse_voltage" to get ocr_avail patch.

Changes from v1:
*) return on -EPROBE_DEFER and other fatal errors. (Don't return only
   if the return value is -ENODEV)
*) Remove the beagle x15 dts patch. It can be part of a different
   series.
*) Avoid using regulator_is_enabled for vqmmc since if the regulator
   is shared and the other users are not using regulator_is_enabled
   then there can be unbalanced regulator_enable/regulator_disable

I've pushed this patch series to
git://git.ti.com/linux-phy/linux-phy.git mmc_for-next

Please note the branch also has the pbias fixes [1].

This series is in preparation for implementing the voltage switch
sequence so that UHS cards can be supported.

Did basic read/write test in J6, J6 Eco, Beagle-x15, AM437x EVM,
Beaglebone black, OMAP5 uEVM, OMAP4 PANDA and OMAP3gle xm.

  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: use mmc_host's vmmc and vqmmc
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: remove unnecessary pbias set_voltage
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: return error if any of the regulator APIs fail
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: add separate functions for enable/disable
    supply
  mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: add separate function to set pbias
