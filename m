After applying it, omap_hsmmc.c looks like this here:

        seq_printf(s, "mmc%d:\n ctx_loss:\t%d:%d\n fclk:\t\t%lu Hz\n\nr=
egs:\n",
                mmc->index, host->context_loss, context_loss,
                        clk_get_rate(host->fclk));

(That's with tabs converted to spaces for e-mail.)

So you're right that the original lines are indented a character too fa=
r
to the right, but after your patch there are different indentations use=
d
for lines 2 and 3 above, so that's worse than it was before.

All of the seq_printf() calls in omap_hsmmc.c have the same indentation
one space too far to the right.  I guess we should just stick with it.

Thanks,

- Chris.
