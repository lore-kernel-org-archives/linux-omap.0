i bisected it down to this commit:

commit e002264f7e45d7661b237045577052fd0b40f89c

    mmc: omap_hsmmc: Fix pbias_disable for omap4
    
    pbias_disable is set to protect the mmc pbias i/o cells in DT boot
    by preventing voltage switch. Currently pbias_disable is enabled only
    for omap3 and not for omap4 due to reg_offset difference of 0x100.
    Enable pbias_disable for omap4+ too by using res->start
    which does not include the reg_offset.

with this commit reverted, i can reboot in a loop for hours without any problem,
while if i keep this patch, my pandas don't survive more that two hours (again,
it's really random as it could hang a couple of times in a row and then work
like a charm for ten reboots straight).

Any idea? does it ring any bell?
