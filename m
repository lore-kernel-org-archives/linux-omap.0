Hi all,

Here are the update SDIO remuxing patches that are based on Andreas'
earlier patches. The remuxing part is still in discussion, but that
can be merged later in case there's some way to do it automatically
at the drivers/base/pinctrl.c level.

I've used these patches successfully with wl12xx and mwifiex_sdio
on at least omap3 zoom, omap3 evm, omap4 sdp, and panda es.

Regards,

Tony
