OK. Do we need the standard regulator property startup-delay-us for the
PBIAS regulator then? Or if it's always fixed, I guess it could be done
in the pbias_regulator_enable()?

If they truly are compatible, then usually the earliest revision name is
used. So I guess we should use the omap2430 naming instead of omap3 naming.

Sounds like using the omap2430 naming would solve that.
