The TI OMAP 34xx TRM is the one of the most obtuse document I've had to
read.  An even after multiple reads of relevant sections it still
doesn't make sense.  Parts are contradictory, parts are poorly explained
and some bit are just plain incorrect.

I don't have time to sort out any of this properly -- it works well
enough for me.
