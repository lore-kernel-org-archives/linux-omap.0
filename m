Change the handling for the 'abort' flag so that if
it is set, but we can claim the host, then do the claim,
rather than aborting.

When the abort is async this just means that a race between aborting
an allowing a claim is resolved slightly differently.  Any
code must already be able to handle 'abort' being set just as the host
is claimed.

This allows extra functionality.  If __mmc_claim_host() is called
with an 'abort' pointer which is initialized to '1', it will effect a
non-blocking 'claim'.
