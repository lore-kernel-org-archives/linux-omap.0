Sure. It must be a clock driver. I already have similar driver (for McP=
DM fclk
clock) for twl6040.
Let me check linux-next, if CCF is there for OMAP I can send the 32k cl=
ock
driver soon (after writing it and testing it). It is going to be for 3.=
9 but
we can roll it with us I think locally to resolv issues.
