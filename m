To put it clear, current git does not work and it is unrelated to your patch.
If driver works for you with your patch, then either your MMC card or
controller in your SoC survives multiple init sequences or it has something
to do with clock settings or... You can find two more people confirming
this here: http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-omap/msg09547.html
I'll probably need to find some time to read MMC spec.
