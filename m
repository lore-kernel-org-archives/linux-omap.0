I think it's possible to use tweak this to use PIO should DMA_ENGINE
not be available - though first we need to sort out all the filter
functions and how we select the DMA channels.  That's pretty much an
open question (which was brought up in my original set of patches)
and remains to these ones.

How we did this with the AMBA Primecell drivers was to pass in the
filter function and filter argument from platform code, allowing the
primecell drivers to be used with any DMA engine.  That doesn't work
with DT though...

At the moment, I don't have an answer for this, because of the DT
implications here.  So, the issue is rather stuck, and as a result
I'm just sticking the "extern" declarations for the filter function
into drivers that have been converted.
