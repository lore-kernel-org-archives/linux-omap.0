No, no, no. You should not have to specify the unit-address in the compatible
field. They are all programmed the same way, right?

Also, they should go from the specific to the generic, but the first property
is the same for 2/3 and 4. That's wrong.

I didn't think hwmod bindings were settled on yet?

ti,dual-voltage is a better name here (by definition, if it has the property it
supports it, the word "supports" is redundant).

You shouldn't have to specify this, it can be derived from the number of child
nodes.

you can drop hsmmc- from the properties here

Please use the same standard as the other mmc controllers for CD/WP.

What is OCR mask?

Same here, non-removable should be standardized.
