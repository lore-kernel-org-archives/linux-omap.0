That's interesting, because many drivers do this, especially since they
were converted to DT probing. Mostly because that way, the platform data
logic in callback functions can be reused, and often the platform
specific data is only stored in pdata and taken from there during the
lifetime of a device.

Is there any particular reason why this approach is frowned upon?

A copy of what exactly? Of all members of the legacy pdata you mean?


Thanks,
