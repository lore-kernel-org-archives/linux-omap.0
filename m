heh; I did get rather verbose there.

I saw those.  I also notice that they are only used by device_move()
when reparenting a device (which is another wrinkle I hadn't though
about).  Reparenting a device becomes problematic if the probe order
is also represented in the list.  If device_move() gets called, then
any implicit probe-order sorting for that device would be lost.

I also notice that device_move disregards any children when moving a
device, which could also be a problem.

Although it looks like the only users of device_move are:

drivers/media/video/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-v4l2.c
drivers/s390/cio/device.c
net/bluetooth/hci_sysfs.c
net/bluetooth/rfcomm/tty.c

So it may not be significant to adapt.
