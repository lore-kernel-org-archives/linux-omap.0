I have been seeing allocation failures in edma_prep_slave_sg
allocating the descriptor list of order 3, which from my rough
calculations is an sg_len of ~800. The memory usage itself doesn't
seem like a problem but doing a GFP_ATOMIC allocation of higher order
under I/O load seems like it is always going to cause problems.

I'm not an expert on this code but it looks like the scatterlist is
created from the queue so if the queue gets full we can get a very
large scatterlist. The current value of 1024 seems to be something of
an outlier:
