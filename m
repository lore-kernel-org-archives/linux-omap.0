With commit c55d7a055364 my guess is that the PBIAS regulator is
already on from an earlier MMC probe and getting re-enabled when
a deferred probe happens?

And with commit 7d607f917008 I'm guessing we can't return an
error if the PBIAS regulator does not exist as that's not there
for the legacy booting.
