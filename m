I looked  at the commit fa372a51cb5f93800f711473e5a36e0e0c9a8f00 which
moved .card_event out of mmc_gpio_cd_irqt. It points to two threads
where discussion to move .card_event to mmc_rescan happened[1][2]. The
concern there was this callback was being called from "atomic context"
but, I don't understand how threaded irq is "atomic context". (I am not
sure, if this is because those drivers have irqs disabled till threaded
irq is complete) But, I believe moving card_event callback back to
mmc_gpio_cd_irqt may break some drivers.
I will look into this further.
Do you have any insight on this commit? Thanks!
