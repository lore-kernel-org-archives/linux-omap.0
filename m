As for the twl-regulator I still have plan to do a major cleanup there.=
 It is
just sad that it received the DT bindings for the current code. The DT =
support
addition would have been the perfect place to sanitize it. Now it is ju=
st
going to be a huge pain in the back.

As for the 32k clock:
I don't know the state of the common clock framework for OMAPs. Is it a=
lready
up in 3.7? Or going for 3.8? 3.9? 3.10?...
We need CCF to resolve this. I can cook up the clock driver for the 32k=
 clock
from twl, but in order to use it we need CCF on OMAP.
