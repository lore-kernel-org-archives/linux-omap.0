Hardware supports ECB, CBC, CTR, CFB, F8, CBC_MAC, F9, GCM, CCM, XTS modes.
But current driver has only ECB, CBC, CTR modes support.
That is why the other fields are not yet defined.
So, defining these is fine, but ORing all these will be very big and looks a bit ugly.
So I kept it as mask of all these bits.
Ill move it to GEN_MASK here only.

Thanks and regards,
