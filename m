Define a generic fncpy() implementation largely based on the ARM version
that requires an 8 bytes alignment for the destination address where to
copy this function as well as the function's own address.

+ * These macros are intended for use when there is a need to copy a low-level
+ * function body into special memory.
+ *
+ * For example, when reconfiguring the SDRAM controller, the code doing the
+ * reconfiguration may need to run from SRAM.
+ *
+ * NOTE: that the copied function body must be entirely self-contained and
+ * position-independent in order for this to work properly.
+ *
+ * NOTE: in order for embedded literals and data to get referenced correctly,
+ * the alignment of functions must be preserved when copying.  To ensure this,
+ * the source and destination addresses for fncpy() must be aligned to a
+ * multiple of 8 bytes: you will be get a BUG() if this condition is not met.
+ * You will typically need a ".align 3" directive in the assembler where the
+ * function to be copied is defined, and ensure that your allocator for the
+ * destination buffer returns 8-byte-aligned pointers.
+ *
+ * Typical usage example:
+ *
+ * extern int f(args);
+ * extern uint32_t size_of_f;
+ * int (*copied_f)(args);
+ * void *sram_buffer;
+ *
+ * copied_f = fncpy(sram_buffer, &f, size_of_f);
+ *
+ * ... later, call the function: ...
+ *
+ * copied_f(args);
+ *
+ * The size of the function to be copied can't be determined from C:
+ * this must be determined by other means, such as adding assmbler directives
+ * in the file where f is defined.
