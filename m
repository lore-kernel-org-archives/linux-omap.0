First thing to note: there are several error conditions *after*
pm_runtime_enable() and the first _get_sync() are called.

So here's what can happen:

The driver core does a _get_noresume() before calling the driver's
probe, so the runtime PM usecount is already 1 when the driver is
called.  The _get_sync() in _probe enables the device and increases the
usecount to 2.  The _put_sync() at the end of ->probe() will decrease
the usecount to 1, but since the usecount is still non-zero, the
driver's callbacks are still not called.  It's not until the driver core
does its _put_sync (to balance the _get_noresume() that the usecount
goes to zero and the driver's callbacks are called.

When probe succeeds, this all works fine.  However, if probe fails the
host pointer is set to NULL, but the runtime PM callbacks are still
called and attempt to dereference a NULL pointer.

I guess this problem is probably not a regression and has been around
for some time.  It has not been seen because probe has not failed.

In using recent l-o master though, with Russell's dmaengine changes
merged, probe is failing for me becasue it can't allocate a DMA channel,
and then I'm seeing this problem.
