OMAP4 and OMAP3 HSMMC IP registers differ by 0x100 offset.
Addng the offset to platform_device resource structure
increments the start address for every insmod operation.
MMC command fails on re-insertion as module due incorrect register base=
=2E
=46ix this by updating the ioremap base address only.

Note:  eMMC detection is still failing on resertion due to card vcc
power off on rmmod
