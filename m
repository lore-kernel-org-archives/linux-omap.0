Did you also revert the above two commits?

I've pushed a 'tmp/mmc' branch to my git tree[1] which is my PM branch
(including various PM stuff queued for upstream) as well as Benoit's
series with the TEMP patches above reverted and your series on top of
it.  There's one additional patch to convert the dev_dbg into dev_info
to see the transitions.

Testing this on my OMAP4430 ES2.2 EMU device, I still see the above
behavior.

Can you try out this branch on your board using the default
omap2plus_defconfig?

Thanks,

Kevin
