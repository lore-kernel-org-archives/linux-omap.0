Wow! A mystery finally solved for why libertas_sdio using devices
like overo won't work for the wakeirqs.. The interface has to be
in 1-bit mode for libertas to produce any SDIO interrupts..

Below is a patch enabling some more SDIO wakeirqs. Seems to work
on overo now too :) So tor the whole series, please feel free to
add:

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: Fix omap3 SDIO wakeirqs for devices using sdio_libertas

Turns out the the MMC interface needs to be in 1-bit mode for the
libertas card to send any SDIO interrupts as pointed out by
NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>. Now that the MMC framework is getting
fixed for setting 1-bit mode for idle, we can enable SDIO wakeirqs
for libertas using devices too.
