Changes since v3:
	- Added hwmod support for SIDLEMODE.  This requires adding
	  a specific omap_hwmod_sysc_fields structure since there
	  are not generic ones that have the correct offsets.
	- Added patch to remove the cpu check from the omap-sham
	  driver.  This can likely be ignored since there is a patch
	  that already does this in Tony's branch.  I added it to
	  make it easier for others to test while Tony's patch makes
	  its way to the k.o.

Changes since v2:
	- Reworked pm_runtime calls to match where original clk_*
	  calls were so provide better PM (as per Kevin Hilman's
	  comments).

Changes since v1:
	- Removed the check of CM_IDLEST to see if the module exists
	  and instead add the hwmod data for all omap2's and omap3 GP's.
	- Placed new sha_ick clk entries after the 'omap-sham' entry
	  in the clockxxx_data.c files
	- Removed cpu_is_xxx() checks in
	  arch/arm/mach-omap2/devices.c:omap_init_sham()
	- Rebased on the latest k.o. kernel


This series updates the crypto omap-sham driver and supporting
infrastructure.

Notes:

a) Based on 3587b1b (fanotify: fix FAN_Q_OVERFLOW case of fanotify_read()).

b) Since these patches will likely go though the OMAP tree (and not
   through the crypto tree), it would be nice if the crypto guy(s)
   would ACK or NACK patches 5-7 which modify the
   drivers/crypto/omap-sham.c driver.

c) These have only been tested on an omap2420 h4 and an am37x evm.  If you
   have different hardware available and a few minutes, please test them.
   A quick and easy test is to enable tcrypt as a module
   (CONFIG_CRYPTO_TEST=m), boot, then run 'modprobe tcrypt sec=2 mode=403'.
   'CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA1' and 'CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_OMAP_SHAM' also have to be
   enabled.  A quick 'grep omap-sham /proc/interrupts' will tell you if
   the omap-sham driver was really used.

d) To test these patches, you will likely need...
   i) The patch included here:
	   http://marc.info/?l=kernel-janitors&m=134910841909057&w=2
   ii) This patch from linux-omap/master:
	   27615a9 (ARM: OMAP: Trivial driver changes to remove include
			   plat/cpu.h)
   iii) This patch from Paul Walmsley:
	   http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-omap/msg79436.html

e) If you prefer, a version you can test is available at
   git@github.com:mgreeraz/linux-mag.git wip/crypto/sham-v3+test

f) There is a reduction in DMA performance after switching to dmaengine
   (see http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-omap/msg79855.html)

g) Many thanks to Jon Hunter for testing on his omap2420 h4.
