Yes you're right, there should not be any need to select active state
in probe, that should be selected by PM runtime.

At least for omaps, there's no need to select default in
runtime_resume as the default pins stay that way.

For omaps, we would just select idle pins again in the
suspend case.

And for omaps, there's no need to select default in resume
either. Just selecting active would do the trick for resume.

So for omaps, the sequence would be:

probe:
 -> default (typically all device pins except rx pin)

runtime_suspend:
suspend:
 -> idle (remux rx pin from device to gpio input for wake)
 
runtime_resume:
resume:
 -> active (remux rx pin from gpio input to device)

Yes the "active" is needed, but "sleep" would be unused for
omaps.

Sounds good to me as long as we don't always need to select
the default pins over and over in PM runtime_resume.

Well the difference seems to be that you need to remux all the
device pins for runtime_suspend and resume while in most of the
cases I know of only one device pins needs to be toggled and the
rest can be selected in driver probe.
