Hi,

This patchset contains the missing speech data support for the
Nokia N900 modem.

Userland access goes via /dev/cmt_speech. The API is implemented in
libcmtspeechdata, which is used by ofono and the freesmartphone.org project.
Apart from that the device is also used by the phone binaries distributed
with Maemo. So while this is a new userland ABI for the mainline kernel it
has been tested in the wild for some years.

Simple Testing of the API can be done by checking out libcmtspeechdata [0],
building the test tool and executing it. The tool will loop back audio data
received from the caller.

I have prepared a kernel branch, which includes these changes at [1].
