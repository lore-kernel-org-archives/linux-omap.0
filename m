=46irst, answers to your questions:

The CIRQ bit in the STAT register is on if the CIRQ is enabled in the
IE register and clear when disabled in the IE.  That is to say that
the IE register appears to be working.

Yes the card has no pending irqs.

IBG is set really early when the card is discovered.  First interrupt
does not occur until much later when the libertas driver asks for
interrupts.

The lines have pull ups.

Now a thought.

Do we  need to set DDIR in the CMD reg for CIRQ to work correctly?
Right now it is set at the beginning of data read commands, cleared on
data write commands and otherwise untouched.  If DDIR is used
unconditionally to set the direction of the data line buffers then it
would make sense that we need to set the direction to in in order to
monitor the DAT1 line.  I will try this Monday when I get back to
work.

John
