I generally perform my tests with omap2plus_defconfig and without this
series MMC doesn't work with omap2plus_defconfig.

Just checked multi_v7_defconfig and this series is definitely required
to get MMC working. But we also have to enable 'CONFIG_REGULATOR_PBIAS'
which is not enabled by default in multi_v7_defconfig.

So we should have a patch to enable 'CONFIG_REGULATOR_PBIAS' in
multi_v7_defconfig to completely solve the problem reported by Olof.
I'll prepare a patch for multi_v7_defconfig and post it asap.

Thanks
