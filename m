Yes.  

As Santosh pointed out, keep the changelog. and add any comments about
how this differs from previous versions after the '---' in the
changelog.

Keep in mind that the changelog will be stored in the git history and
should be useful without having to reference previous versions etc.

Anything useful to the reviewers but not important for the changelog
should go after the '---' since that will be ignored by git when
applying.
