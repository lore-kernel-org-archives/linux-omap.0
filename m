The following add driver patches for porting TI's am335x and am437x
devices to the sdhci-omap driver.

This involves adding external DMA support to sdhci (first 3 patches from
Chunyan) plus some miscellaneous patches to take care of deviations of
the controllers from the sdhci model.

DT changes will be posted in a separate series.

Untested versions of Chunyan's patches were posted before[1].

Tested on: am335x-evm, am335x-boneblack, am335x-sk, am437x-gpevm,
am43xx-gpevm, am437x-idk, dra7xx-evm, dra72x-evm

v2:
1. sdhci is using two bottom halves. One threaded_rq for card detect and a
   tasklet for finishing mmc requests. Patch 1 removes the tasklet and
   moves its function to the threaded_irq. This enables me to
   terminate_sync() in sdhci_request_done()

2. Factored out common code for between the normal adn external dma case

3. Using existing API sdhci_data_timeout_irq for disabling DTO during
   erase commands.

4. Fixed subject line for dt-bindings patch.
