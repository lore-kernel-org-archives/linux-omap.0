Tony, John, let me please suggest merging this through the wireless tre=
e.

wl1271 is a moving target - it keeps changing in the wireless tree and
merging this patchset there will allow wl1271 developers to have
everything in a single tree (and prevent merge conflicts in
linux-next).

If that's ok with you, I will rebase this on top of wireless-testing
and resubmit.
