Your patch sets up the capability to enable sdio irqs anyway. My question
was more related to the idle path. In a scenario where you start using the
SDIO functionality and after some time you leave the SDIO card idle, does
the FCLK still remain enabled? Or do you see that sdio_irq_thread exits and
disables the FCLK?
