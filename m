That's what I thought, thanks.

We try multiple of our system ( Different micro SD from SanDisk +
Overo with OMAP3) and they are all doing this with the SanDisk 64GB,
32GB :
http://www.sandisk.com/products/memory-cards/microsd/ultra-class10-for-=
android/?capacity=3D64GB

The problem seem to be easier to reproduce when we just flash the
micro SD (partition, format & copy rootfs) at it first boot.
Also, when we let the system down for a couple of days and then
sometimes we need to reboot the system multiple times before it fall
back alright.

We found a old patch that was simply increasing the timeout of the host=
:
http://cgit.openembedded.org/cgit.cgi/openembedded/tree/recipes/linux/l=
inux-omap-2.6.39/sakoman/0024-omap-mmc-Adjust-dto-to-eliminate-timeout-=
errors.patch?h=3Dorg.openembedded.dev

By settings the timeout to zero I reproduce kind of the same timeout
error at every boot. That was expected since I don't let enough time
to the controller to respond...

Could the mix of that MMC controller and these card is not optimal? Is
the driver fully supporting the UHS-I speed grade?

Regards,
