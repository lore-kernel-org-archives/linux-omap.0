Really?  When we've only currently used approximately 2^9 of a 2^31
numberspace?  I'm fine with making sure that the number doesn't show
up in the userspace headers, but it makes no sense to overload the
#defines.  Particularly so in this case where it isn't feasible to
audit every driver to figure out what probe might possibly return.  It
is well within the realm of possibility that existing drivers are
already returning -EAGAIN.

Besides; linux/errno.h *already* has linux-internal error codes that
do not get exported out to userspace.  There is an #ifdef __KERNEL__
block around ERESTARTSYS through EIOCBRETRY which is filtered out when
exporting headers.  I can't see any possible reason why we wouldn't
add Linux internal error codes here.
