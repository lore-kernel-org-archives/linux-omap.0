Hi Neil,

Thanks for sending this patchset, and sorry for the delay in response.

Overall I like the approach taken in this patchset, though I have some
questions see below.

As omap_hsmmc in currently the only user of the
host_ops->enable|disable() callbacks, I wonder if this approach will
work "race-free" for those hosts that don't implement these callbacks?

Also, I was kind of hoping that we should be able to remove these
host_ops callbacks, when omap_hsmmc has moved away from using them. Do
you think that can be done?

Within this context, I am also reviewing Adrian Hunter's patchset
around "periodic re-tuning" [1] and to me, you guys are sharing a
similar issue.

The host driver's runtime PM suspend callback needs to be able to
notify the mmc core to take some specific actions, and in a
"race-free" manner.

I wonder whether we could have one common solution to that? Do you
think this approach will work for Adrian's "periodic re-tuning" as
well?
