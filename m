Thanks a lot for your insights; high level design decisions are quite
hard to understand from C code.

I see that you may not have data available in "downlink" scenario, but
how is it lossy in "uplink" scenario? Phone should always try to fill
the uplink, no? (Or do you detect silence and not transmit in this
case?) (Actually, I guess applications should be ready for "data not
ready" case even on "normal" hardware due to differing clocks.)

Packets vs. stream of samples... does userland need to know about the
packets? Could we simply hide it from the userland? As userland daemon
is (supposed to be) realtime, do we really need extra set of
timestamps? What other metadata are there?

Uplink timing... As the daemon is realtime, can it just send the data
at the right time? Also normally uplink would be filled, no?

Well, packets are of fixed size, right? So the userland can simply
supply the right size in the common case. As for sending at the right
time... well... if the userspace is already real-time, that should be
easy. 

Now, there's a difference in the downlink. Maybe ALSA people have an
idea what to do in this case? Perhaps we can just provide artificial
"zero" data?

Yes, understood.
