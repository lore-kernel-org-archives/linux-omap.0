Great, tested here and things work for me for waking omap3
from off-idle based on the SDIO interrupt.

Maybe leave out the trailing period from the Subject line
for the last patch? If you look at git log --pretty=oneline
the trailing period is rarely used :)

Balaji, care to queue or ack these for Chris? Looks like
Chris has a wrong email address (corrected in this mail),
so maybe one more repost of the series is needed.

Regards,

Tony
