Last night's build shows that this fixes the non-DT LDP3430 booting, but
DT-based LDP3430 and SDP4430 both remain broken for the same reason -
neither can find their SD cards.

We're at -rc4.  That means we're could be only three weeks away from 4.3
being released, and DT OMAP has yet to boot _once_ here.

What I find *totally* unacceptable is the lack of reaction from the MMC
and TI people: it's just like "we'll break your crap, and we'll ignore
reports of regressions."  That is *not* acceptable in any shape or form,
and people who do this _should_ have their future patches ignored until
they demonstrate that they understand the need to not break stuff.

I'm at the point of suggesting that there should be a moritorium on all
OMAP related development for 4.4: delay all development to 4.5, and have
4.4 as a pure bug-fixing _only_ cycle for OMAP.  If 4.3 is released and
OMAP is still broken, then I don't think there's an option on that.

Maybe the idea that development work won't hit mainline for another 4
months will help focus the minds on not breaking stuff and then ignoring
regression reports.
