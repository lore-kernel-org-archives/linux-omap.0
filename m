Sure. To help with giving Ack for this, I'd like to also mention these patches
were due for long time and reposted. The supporting code is already in the kernel.

Also bindings were reviewed by Mark Rutland comments in the following thread

http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg269006.html

Mark, could you give Ack for these patches if they look OK?

thanks,
