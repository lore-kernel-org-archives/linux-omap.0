Yes, I agree.

But I am just the poor guy who is trying to fix really broken code with
as low effort as possible.

I don't even have a significant clue what this code is exactly doing and =
what
the magic values mean. They were setup by pandora_wl1251_init_card() in =
the
same way so that I have just moved the code here and make it called in =
(almost)
the same situation.

You mean a second subnode?

The wl1251 is the child node of the mmc node and describes the SDIO =
card.
We just check if it is a wl1251 or e.g. wl1837 or something else or even
no child.

So while I agree that it should be improved in the long run, we should
IMHO fix the hack first (broken since v4.9!), even if it remains a hack
for now. Improving this part seems to be quite independent and focussed
on the mmc subsystem, while the other patches involve other subsystems.

Maybe should we make a REVISIT note in the code? Or add something to
the commit message about the idea how it should be done right?
