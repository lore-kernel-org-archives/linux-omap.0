Looks much better now.

Mind that the sdio irq is level triggered. So we have to disable the
IRQ in the handler otherwise we enter an infinite loop.

I added this comment to the patch, since I was puzzled that you need
a wake_irq even whithout remuxing.

Will send out another patch soon. Left your Signed-off as well, not
in the sense of your agreement, but didn't dare to remove it because
