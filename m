Yes sounds like it would be a usable generic binding. Not sure
that it should be called slot-name though, maybe you can use
the MMC driver instance name instead? I don't think much any drivers
support multiple MMC slots although it's in the original MMC spec.

If setting up the generic binding is expected to take a while,
you can naturally pass it in pdata while waiting for the generic
binding to get merged.
