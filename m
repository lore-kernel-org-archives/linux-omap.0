I should probably do so together with adding better descriptions on
what happens and what the intention is.

> post request function?
The reason for calling DMA terminate here is to handle the case of
cleaning up an MMC request that has only been prepared in
mmci_pre_request(), and not been passed to mmci_request().
The if (err) is only true if that scenario has happened. The variable
err may need to be better defined. I can think of three states:
1. err =3D=3D no error
2. err =3D=3D mmc request failed
3. err =3D=3D mmc request is prepared but not started
Currently "err" is only set if #3 occurs.

The parts to clean up in post_request() if #3 happens (err =3D=3D true)=
:
in mmci: DMA mapped memory and prepared DMA descriptors
in omap_hsmmc: DMA mapped memory

Now when I think more about I need to check the DMA drivers more
closely if dma_terminate_all() will free resources for prepared but
not submitted descriptors. I will have to add this support to the dma
drivers if it's missing.

I agree, I need to look more closely on the error handling.
