Also added this comment, since it really clarifies the issue.

FYI, just tried the patch without pin remuxing on am335x and
it actually works. Read: I'm always using the sdio pinmux never
reconfiguring the pin as a GPIO, but still get GPIO interrupts.
Yes, it fails if I comment out the pm_runtime_resume.

So it's not that the am335x suddenly has a swakeup line,
but looks like an implementation detail of the am335x GPIO
block.
