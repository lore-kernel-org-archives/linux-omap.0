Hmm, finally got around looking into this again. Looks like the mmc
is now working on my zoom3 with the current Linus' tree at commit 
7c6bd2010fced38444c9fd658f4c6ce61bd185bf. So I guess something that
we had in omap-fixes fixed this. Or maybe some fix for drivers/mmc?

This is with the debug_ll patch applied:
