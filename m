right but sdhci-omap is still lacking features that was present in omap_hsmmc
like context save/restore, SDIO support etc. I think we should deprecate
omap_hsmmc compatible once we add all the features in sdhci-omap?

This is mainly for old dt compatibility. Even after removing the omap_hsmmc
driver, users should still be able to use newer kernel with their existing dtbs.
