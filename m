Ok, except for the one minor nit below my last scissor patch is good to go.

Nope I don't agree with this at all.. EDMA CC ctrl will not be hardcoded. We
need to write future-proof code to make sure sudden regressions don't pop up
when say a second EDMA CC is introduced.. further edma_cc[ctrl] pattern is used
all through out the code so what you're asking to do doesn't make much sense in
this context. There's no reason to break out of this pattern. It actually will
confuse the reader more.

Second controller can be present in future. I don't want to come back to change
the code when we introduce more than 1 CC which is possible in the future.

What you're asking to do infact breaks consistency with the rest of the code.

Even if it is not encoded, the data structure for edma_cc is an array and what
you're asking is to hardcode the controller number to 0 always. No way I'm going
to hard code controller number to a single value.

Different topic but anyway why wouldn't ctrl number be encoded in the channel?
That's clean, and saves variables and extra structures. Better use of the
integer bitmap making up the Ctrl and channel number of small ranges.
