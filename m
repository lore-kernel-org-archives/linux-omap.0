Hmm it should not be luck based, loading omap_hsmmc module
should fail with a sensible error if the configured card detect
or write protect is not available.

I guess this is with twl6030 non-gpio based card detect?

If so, I'll add something to pass the twl6030 card detect from
pdata so we can fail with a sensible error in that case too.

Also, sounds like twl as module and mmc built in case won't
work without deferred probe. But at least there is a sensible
error for that. And maybe we can prevent that in Kconfig.

Yes let's add the teardown patch as a fix for now, but let's
plan on getting rid of the twl_setup callback function
completely.

With these patches LCD and WLAN too can request the twl gpios
directly from the driver based on gpio_chip + gpio offset.
