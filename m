After playing with this a little, I am getting convinced that the way
to go here is to add runtime pm support to MMC/SDIO.

It just fits perfectly into this model:

Runtime PM already takes care of usage count per device (so it would
tell if an SDIO function is idle), takes into account parent-child
relationships (so if all SDIO functions are idle, it would
automatically send an idle request to the card device), doesn't break
existing drivers (drivers needs to explicitly enable it), play along
nicely with the system suspend/resume, etc..

I'm going to split the patches to two:
- first half would be basic wl1271 support for omap/zoom. it's pretty
straight forward and can probably already go thru.
- second half would be adding runtime PM to SDIO/MMC. I'll post some
initial patches to set off a discussion.

Thanks,
Ohad.
