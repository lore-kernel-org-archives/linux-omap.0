It's the source and destination addresses bus port, so it's more related
to the addresses than request signal. I guess routing of the DMA request
signal is what it really does.

I'm now wondering if it might be possible to set it automatically based on
source and destination address.

There's some information in the omap5912 trm on pages 717 and 718:

http://www.ti.com/litv/pdf/spru742

It says for CSDP source port "This field identifies the port originator of
the transfer."

Regards,

Tony
