Yes pinctrl is optional for sure. And leaving pinctrl out does not
produce an unusable kernel for some boards that do all the pin muxing
in the bootloader. Like Andreas says, only some boards need dynamic
pin muxing for the wake-up events.

The dev_info change sounds like papering over the issue.. I'm fine
with that, but isn't the real problem devm_pinctrl_get prototype?

Yes.
