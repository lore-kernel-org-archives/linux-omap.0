Ok - I'll work on getting polling mode to work, but as you know it's
not the mode to get the best performance out of the device.
I see that you've also merged the changes to omap2plus_defconfig, which should
get MMC working as before DMA Engine conversion.

There's a small patch needed to omap_hsmmc to return a non-zero error code
during the probe error path. This will atleast make probe failure
explicit when DMA
is not available.

Let me know if you want me to post it separately as a patch..
