Well, I am not in favour of exporting sdhci_finish_command().
So I had a look and it is not obvious why you need to call it.
What about something this:

	if (omap_host->is_tuning && host->cmd && !host->data_early &&
	    (intmask & CMD_ERR_MASK)) {

		if (intmask & SDHCI_INT_TIMEOUT)
			host->cmd->error = -ETIMEDOUT;
		else
			host->cmd->error = -EILSEQ;

		host->cmd = NULL;

		sdhci_writel(host, intmask & CMD_MASK, SDHCI_INT_STATUS);
		intmask &= ~CMD_MASK;
	}
