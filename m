For high speed modes like UHS SDR104 and HS200, sampling clock has to adjusted
according to the position of the data window and it varies depending on the
host and the card.
For this we configure the controller with phase delay from 0 to 0x7c (in steps
of 4) and send the tuning command (CMD19 or CMD21) for which the card responds
with a known pattern. We keep track of the phase delay's for which we received
the known patterns (without errors) and select one of the phase delays (3/4th
ratio from largest consecutive successful phase delay window).

sdhci driver makes use of the HW feature for tuning (no manual setting of phase
delays etc). Sdhci has an ops for platform specific tuning but that again has
to be implemented in omap_hsmmc driver.

[PATCH 13/41] mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: Add support to set IODELAY values adds
version member to 'struct omap_hsmmc_platform_data'.

Sure.
