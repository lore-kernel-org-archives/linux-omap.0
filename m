I am not saying that it is wrong. My point here is that adding this
particular flag into MMC platform data to differentiate a SDMA specific
feature which got introduced post certain SOC may not be needed. But you can
always post your comments on the list which will be looked at by a wider
audience and finally the right patch will go in.
