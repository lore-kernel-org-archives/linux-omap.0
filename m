Sure, it's a vicious circle.  In any case, I still endure using it and
going against the flow. ;)

You're right.  I also had problems with MMC in a Pandaboard too, but I
didn't even bother investigating it (yet) because I can use my other
setup.

Right, my report was a bit vague indeed.  What I meant by "plus a couple
of associated patches" was the things that would break compilation if I
reverted only the patch in question.  Most likely I ended up reverting
your whole patchset.

I didn't provide further analysis because I had already spent too much
time trying to figure out how to get my stuff to work.  Reverting the
patches locally and hoping someone would respond to my report was good
enough for me at the time.

I also agree that someone from OMAP should have picked it up, but my
report went out exactly when the bomb was exploding inside TI.  So that
probably explains it.
