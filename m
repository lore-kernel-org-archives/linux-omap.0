The issue of pdata tinkering needs to be fixed first as it will cause nasty
issues when the module is reprobed. 

Note that it's still possible to pass platform data in the device tree case
as auxdata. And we probably need to do that for the pbias register handling
until we have a driver for that.

Talking of the pbias driver, any news on it?

To recap, we basically we need a minimal separate driver that exposes the
control module pbias register as a regulator to the hsmmc driver. I don't see
that we can remove the platform data from the driver before that's done.

Tony
