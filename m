It appears to never get cleared in the status register.

I added some printks to sdio_irq.c to print the pending interrupts in
the SDIO_CCCR_INTx register for the card and there are no pending
interrupts so I don't think it is a card driver or card issue.

It would be funny if the TRM was wrong and the CIRQ bit is really
cleared by writing 1 to it.  I'll try that.
