Sorry for the delay in replying, I've been travelling for a few weeks
and been in meetings quite a bit. Anyways, it's a 1013037 REV A board,
which seems to be production in the table above.

There's arm kernel parameter for ATAG_REVISION that can be passed from
bootloader and then the board-*.c code can initialize things accordingly
based on the board revision.
