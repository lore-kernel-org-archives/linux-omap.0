Good to see this, few comments below.

This does not seem to support the other PBIAS controls the same
register has?

The PBIAS register is not just for MMC. Depending on the SoC revision,
you may also have 2 - 3 PBIAS devices in the same register. Please check
the 2430 TRM, it has also I2C secondary pulls in this same register. And
on 3430, there PBIAS register has also SIM voltage bits.

Certainly nothing stops from intially implementing the MMC pieces
as those are needed badly, but it should be done in a way where adding
support for the other PBIAS bits can be done easily.

You're also missing the PBIAS interrupts, so it might be worth checking
the code from that point of view also to make sure adding the support
for interrupts won't require massive changes to the driver.

Tony
