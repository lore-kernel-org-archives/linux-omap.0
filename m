Yes, you might be able to do that, but the only thing that can generate
the initramfs is the target system itself, or a similar target system.
For example, you can't sanely generate an initramfs for an ARM Ubuntu
system on an x86 Fedora host.

Distros have the luxury of always being able to do the initramfs
generation on the target system at installation or distro kernel update
time.
