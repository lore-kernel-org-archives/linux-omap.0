Agree the change log needs to be updated  as said  but when
coming to implementation this how it is:

With current mainline kernel, offset appending is already implemented in
mach-omap2/devices.c and works fine [here bases are updated with 0x100
and then passed to driver which has same register offset's as OMAP3].

When hwmod modifications are done to the MMC driver, the base address are
picked from omap_hwmod_44xx_data.c and omap_device is build.
Coming to the driver it still has the same old register offset's as OMAP3 and
there should be a way to add 0x100 some where.

The current patch moves the offset appending to the driver file which is updated
in mach-omap2/hsmmc.c which will fit for current implementation and even
hwmod adaptation.
