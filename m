Kevin,
  Another series from Per Forlin [1] is also modifying the same file,
and might result in merge conflict if this series is queued under OMAP
and the other is queued by Chris.

Chris,
  If you intend to queue [1] into mmc-next, Balaji / myself can repost
this series on
top of it or you'd like to practice some git merge ? Let me know if
there is anything that I can do to help.
