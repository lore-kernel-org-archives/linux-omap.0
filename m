I don't think that changes the situation.  The RX-51 board file represents 
the hardware integration on the device, not MPU power policy.  That's the 
CPUFreq governor's responsibility.  It shouldn't be necessary to hack a 
board file to change the CPU power management policy.  Maybe that is 
acceptable on a device that has been locked down by the manufacturer to 
only boot kernels signed by them, but that's not the case for RX-51.

Denis didn't go into detail on the performance problem that you and he 
observed.  Further info would be welcome.  Hypothesizing, if the problem 
is that MMC does a lot of MPU work before the CPUFreq timer fires to 
re-evaluate performance, then maybe some CPUFreq function call needs to 
exist to ask the CPUFreq governor to elevate MPU speed in advance.  But 
it's hard to say without knowing more about the problem you observed.

Certainly for Maemo 5 Harmattan as shipped that is true.  It's not 
necessarily true if someone wants to boot another distribution like Debian 
and use (for example) a userspace CPUFreq governor on the device.

Could you explain why?  MPU power management policy for an on-chip device 
such as MMC, which is located internally in the OMAP SoC, is board 
hardware-invariant, and so doesn't belong in the board file.  I agree that 
this is dependent on the software distribution.  So we either need to 
understand the problem and come up with a clean way to resolve it, or keep 
hacks like this distribution-specific.

This function, omap_pm_set_min_mpu_freq(), does not even exist in 
mainline, Tony's kernel, or the current PM branch.  Nor does 
CONFIG_BRIDGE_DVFS.  When you look at the file that defines the interface 
for these functions, arch/arm/plat-omap/include/plat/omap-pm.h, you'll 
find this:

   /*
    * CPUFreq-originated constraint
    *
    * In the future, this should be handled by custom OPP clocktype
    * functions.
    */

[...]

   /**
    * omap_pm_cpu_set_freq - set the current minimum MPU frequency
    * @f: MPU frequency in Hz
    *
    * Set the current minimum CPU frequency.  The actual CPU frequency
    * used could end up higher if the DSP requested a higher OPP.
    * Intended to be called by plat-omap/cpu_omap.c:omap_target().  No
    * return value.
    */
   void omap_pm_cpu_set_freq(unsigned long f);

To my reading, this file is quite clear that this function is intended to 
be called only from CPUFreq.

omap_pm_set_min_bus_tput() addresses a different case than 
omap_pm_cpu_set_freq().  It's just intended to ensure that the 
interconnect clock frequency is high enough to sustain the desired data 
rate.  It presumably won't affect the performance problem that this patch 
is intended to address.
