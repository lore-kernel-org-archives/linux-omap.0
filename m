Still nervous. If it is possible to overheat the charger, without
tripping internal fuse, then you'll do it.

dev_info() and a bit better message, or drop it for production?

More importantly.... how does it work with device drawing power for
operation, too?

Imagine device need 500mA with wifi hotspot, nearly nothing while idle.

Idle device. Code will find that it can charge using 1A, backs up to
0.9A. User starts hotspot. Now device will draw 1.4A, overloading the
charger and not charging at all...?
