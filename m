Next time, please post sets like these split into three separate sets
with the cover letter listing possible dependencies. Picking patches
from sets in certain order is a big pain to follow up, and some
maintainers tend to ignore patchsets with dependencies.

I've already applied the dts changes I believe.. So reposting already
applied patches further confuses things. Now I have to figure out what
is already applied..
