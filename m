Yes, they very well might.  However, I'm happy with the limitation
that only leaf devices can take advantage of probe deferral.

Think about that a minute.  Consider a dpm_list of devices:
        abcDefGh

Now assume that D has an implicit dependency on G.  If D gets probed
first, then it will be deferred until G gets probed and then D will
get retried and moved to the end of the list resulting in:
        abcefGhD
Everything is good now for the order that things need to be suspended i=
n.

Now lets assume that the drivers get linked into the kernel in a
different order (or the modules get loaded in a different order) and G
gets probed first, followed by D.  No deferral occurred and so no
reordering occurs, resulting in:
        abcDefGh (unchanged)
But now suspend is broken because D depends on G, but G will be
suspended before D.  This looks and smells like a bug to me.  In fact,
even without using probe deferral it looks like a bug because the
dap_list isn't taking into account the fact that there are very likely
to be implicit dependencies between devices that are not represented
in the device hierarchy (maybe not common in PCs, but certainly is the
case for embedded).  But, it is also easy to solve by ensuring the
dap_list is also probe-order sorted.

I'm really concerned about drivers having to implement this and not
getting it correct; particularly when moving a device to the end of
the list is cheap, and it shouldn't be a problem to do the move
unconditionally after a driver has been matches, but before probe() is
called.  We may be able to keep watch to make sure that drivers using
probe deferral are also reordering themselves, but that does nothing
for the cases described above where the link order of the drivers
determines probe order, not the dap_list order.
