This has been discussed multiple times in the past. No one has come back
with strong reason to add that to the PSCI SYSTEM_SUSPEND API.

Care to explain the difference between PM_SUSPEND_STANDBY and S3 is
PM_SUSPEND_MEM on your platform. And why it can't be achieved with
suspend-to-idle ?

You can always report any issue with PSCI specification at
errata@arm.com as mentioned in the document.
