This version contains updates for some of the comments received from the
previous round, and adds the OMAP1/2 MMC and SPI drivers to the conversion.

I've also added a note to feature-removal noting that the existing APIs
will be removed around 2013 - I'm planning January for that at the
moment.  Having drivers around which are unconverted blocks further work
on the DMA engine conversion, so it's actually important that we get
as many drivers converted as soon as possible.

Anything which isn't converted will probably have its DMA code removed,
or if that results in the driver not being usable, the driver itself
will be removed.

This series is still in RFC mode...
