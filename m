Okay, we'll drop the kconfig

This comment block is stale.  I reworked the code before I handed it
off to Manjunath, but I never rewrote the comment.  The current code
uses a pair of list to keep deferred devices separate from devices
currently being probed, and the problem described above no longer
exists.  However, Manjunath and I will look into switching from the
two list design to using klist.

Thanks for the feedback.
