Paul, David,

Not to add further confusion but as far as I understand SDIO should be able
to asynchronously wakeup OMAP regardless of MMC clocks being OFF . As per
the SDIO spec DAT1 line is used for signaling the card interrupt to the
host. The TRM clearly shows a GPIO connected to DAT1 line for wakeup through
the SDIO interrupt. Wouldn't this help?

Definitely these are good features that are being added. Just that there are
confusions around and not everyone has a setup to validate these features.
If I look in the mainline kernel today there is only one SDIO card driver "
sdio_uart.c". And at least I don't see a way I can test any of these
features myself.
