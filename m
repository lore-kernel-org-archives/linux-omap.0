I think S2 here means PM_SUSPEND_MEM. It is very wrong to manage power
states through platform specific hooks on PSCI based systems, consider
upgrading to PSCI 1.0 please (or implement PSCI CPU_SUSPEND power
states that allow to achieve same power savings as PM_SUSPEND_MEM
by just entering suspend-to-idle).

Just to be clear, thinking of using platform specific suspend hooks
on PSCI systems is not a viable solution, I will let other people
comment on option 2.

"At the moment", where ?

Not to implement suspend hooks on PSCI 0.2 systems.
