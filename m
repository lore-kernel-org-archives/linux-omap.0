Okay. I couldn't really get the eMMC on my board to detect, but
apparently Koen has been able to get it to work. I am not really deep
into details of HSMMC driver so will check with Balaji on what needs to
be done here.

Yes, its minimal amount of code but its code that will very likely never
get exercised in future because of the reasons I mentioned above. I fear
in time we will accumulate a lot of unused code this way.

Anyway, since you don't feel its okay to remove the old binding, I will
go ahead and mark the old binding as deprecated. But perhaps we can
come-up with some time frame within which users of old .dtb can upgrade
their .dtb or consider never upgrading to a newer kernel? This sounds
eerily similar to feature-removal-schedule.txt and yeah I am aware of
what happened to that. But I still put it here since this problem of DTB
compatibility is not going to go away.

One thing that might help is a kernel configuration that does not
support deprecated bindings so users of old dtbs can actually see what
deprecated bindings they are using. This way they can probably plan for
a dtb upgrade better. So in driver you would do something like:

	if (of_support_deprecated_bindings() &&
	    of_find_property(np, "ti,non-removable", NULL)) {
		.. do something ..
	}

of_support_deprecated_bindings() would return based on a config option.

Thanks,
Sekhar
