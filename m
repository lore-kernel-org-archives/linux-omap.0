[Joel] Actually, I feel there is no real benefit in calling runtime PM api so many
times in between crypto operations. The patch just moves the runtime pm usage
to the beginning and end of a crypto session which will have to be created anyway.
Imagine encrypting a 20M block- this means runtime PM API is called
20 * 1024 / 4 =~ 5000 times. The slow down in my opinion doesn't make it worth it.
What is your opinion about this?
I can explore runtime-pm timeouts and propose the numbers to describe what would
the speedup w/ my patch and w/ timeouts.

[Joel] Async was required there because that was in interrupt context. It was originally sync but changed to
async in another separate patch.

Thanks,
Joel
