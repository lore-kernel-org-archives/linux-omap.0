Well, I never saw that patch.  When I say "I'm going to be away for most
of July, and I won't be reading email, and I won't catch up with email
when I'm back" and when I get back I explicitly ask for stuff which needs
my attention sending, that's hardly surprising...

But anyway, as I said above, the "select" option is less desirable because
it forces stuff.  And if you've seen the kind of crap that you have to go
through to figure out why the hell you can't disable an option, you'll
understand why I consider that solution revolting.

Take, for instance, a list of dependencies spits out by menuconfig that
fills your entire screen, and you have to work out by reading carefully
through 2K of characters which combination of options is forcing the one
you want to turn off back on.  That is why "select" used inappropriately
is pure evil incarnate.
