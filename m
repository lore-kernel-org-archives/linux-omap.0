  My understanding from the existing code
<snip>
        /*
         * If for some reason the DMA transfer is still active,
         * we wait for timeout period and free the dma
         */
        if (host->dma_ch !=3D -1) {
                set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
</snip>
 is that it's rare, but not impossible, for the DMA to be active even
when the TC has been received.
  At the same time, I found one issue in descriptor loading
after I sent the email yesterday, which could fix the problem I am seei=
ng.

  Yes, I was testing such a mechanism as well.  Is it better to abort t=
he
transfer by setting an error, or do the omap_hsmmc_xfer_done() at the
callback of whichever
interrupt comes last ?
