Subject: [PATCH] OMAP HSMMC:Fix a bug in card removal scenario

The reset of data lines when the card is removed from the cage results
in a failure.The failure is seen if the card is removed from the cage
when TC is pending after a CMD with data received CC.The reset logic leaves
the controller in a state where niether a TC is received nor DTO.

The rest code can be safely removed here since it is taken care in the IRQ
handler.
