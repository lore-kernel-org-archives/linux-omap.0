Since omap2420 and omap2430 have different MMC controllers (and these
bindings only cover the hsmmc controller used in 2430 and beyond, I
haven't done the bindings for the legacy one yet), the idea was
to differentiate between omap2420 and omap2430 by using
compatible of "ti,omap2-hsmmc" for the High-Speed controller used in
OMAP2 (2430) and "ti,omap2-mmc" for the legacy one used in OMAP2 (2420).
Does that sound good to you?

But these bindings are specific and limited to HSMMC module which is
not quite different in the different SoC variants. There is a single
driver to handle hsmmc module on all the SoCs which does not need to
differentiate which SoC it is on.
