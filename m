An mmc/sdio host which is expecting interrupts from an SDIO card
should not turn off clocks unless the bus is configured to a width
of 1-bit.  In 4-bit mode interrupts may not be generated without
the clock.

This series fixes omap_hsmmc to set 1-bit mode when appropriate
and so allows my wifi chip to work much better.

This is an RFC.  The code seems to work, but I feel it could be
structured better (so that other drivers can share more of it), and
I need to convince myself there is no room for races.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
