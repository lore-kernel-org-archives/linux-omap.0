with Linux 3.6-rc3:

CONFIG_DMA_OMAP=m
CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE=y
CONFIG_DMA_VIRTUAL_CHANNELS=m
CONFIG_MMC_OMAP_HS=y
CONFIG_SPI_OMAP24XX=y
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_OMAP2=y

  LD      init/built-in.o
drivers/built-in.o: In function `omap2_mcspi_setup':
/home/pmeerw/linux-pmeerw/drivers/spi/spi-omap2-mcspi.c:859: undefined reference to `omap_dma_filter_fn'
drivers/built-in.o: In function `omap_nand_probe':

/home/pmeerw/linux-pmeerw/drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.c:2039: undefined reference to `omap_dma_filter_fn'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1

in addition to SPI and MMC, there seems to be also a NAND dependency
