I have seen that drivers check the capabilities themselves after gettin=
g the
channel, so I thought that if we move that also to the core we can save=
 on
duplicated lines around the kernel. It is not needed to get the channel=
=2E As
you can see in the mmc patch, I pass NULL and the channel I got is the =
correct
one.
Sure, I can remove it.

Something like this:

/* include/linux/dmaengine.h */

struct dma_filter_map {
	char *devname;
	char *slave;
	void *param;
};

struct dma_filter {
	dma_filter_fn filter_fn;
	int mapcnt;
	struct dma_filter_map *map;
};

/* arch/arm/mach-davinci/devices-da8xx.c */

static struct dma_filter_map da8xx_edma0_map[] =3D {
	{
		.devname =3D "davinci-mcasp.0",
		.slave =3D "tx",
		.param =3D (void*)DAVINCI_DA8XX_DMA_MCASP0_AXEVT,
	},
	{
		.devname =3D "davinci-mcasp.0",
		.slave =3D "rx",
		.param =3D (void*)DAVINCI_DA8XX_DMA_MCASP0_AREVT,
	},
	{
		.devname =3D "da830-mmc.0",
		.slave =3D "tx",
		.param =3D (void*)DA8XX_DMA_MMCSD0_TX,
	},
	{
		.devname =3D "da830-mmc.0",
		.slave =3D "rx",
		.param =3D (void*)DA8XX_DMA_MMCSD0_RX,
	},
};

I had this version first, but decided to go with a simpler one present =
in this
RFC series.
