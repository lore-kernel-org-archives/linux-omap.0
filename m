Several uses cases come to mind:

- it could be used as a trampoline code prior to entering S2 for systems
that do not support PSCI 1.0

- any code that has a specific need to relocate a performance, security
sensitive code into SRAM and use it as another pool of memory.

For systems that support PSCI 1.0, I agree, but it may not be possible
to update those systems easily, still use case 2 is completely valid.

At the moment we use it to enter S2 on ARM64 systems (ARCH_BRCMSTB)
which are PSCI 0.2 only. And yes, we do have a plan to evaluate
upgrading to PSCI 1.0, but in general, any SoC which as an addressable
SRAM could use it for whatever purpose it sees fit.
