=46rom my understanding, the runtime suspend is usually implemented to =
not
lose the card 'context', i.e. transactions can continue after a
runtime suspend /
resume cycle.

=46or system suspend, the MMC core sends a sleep command (which, in its=
elf,
is a transaction) to the card to go to sleep state, and for all
practical purposes,
the card is treated as 'removed'. When the system resumes, the card is =
rescanned
and re-initialized.

Hence, for system suspend, the MMC controller needs to be enabled to ac=
tually
send the command which puts the card to sleep (and hence the resume).

Best regards,
Venkat.
