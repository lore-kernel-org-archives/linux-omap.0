Looking at this driver, there seems to be some interaction between how
the DMA is programmed for each part of the scatterlist, and how the
MMC interface is programmed, specifically:

        frame =3D data->blksz;
        if (cpu_is_omap15xx() && frame > 32)
                frame =3D 32;
        else if (frame > 64)
                frame =3D 64;
        frame >>=3D 1;
        if (!(data->flags & MMC_DATA_WRITE)) {
                buf =3D 0x800f | ((frame - 1) << 8);
        } else {
                buf =3D 0x0f80 | ((frame - 1) << 0);
        }
        OMAP_MMC_WRITE(host, BUF, buf);

Does this register have to be written on every scatterlist entry, or ca=
n
it be written once at the start of request processing?
