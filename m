Hi Russell, Florian,

Thanks for clarifications. Thumb bit is a good reason to save arm
version, and I completely agree with you in this. Sorry that missed it
in the v1 discussion.

But it seems that v3 does exactly that - copies arm with very small
changes. :) Maybe there are good reasons to have arm version exactly
how it looks now, but in general case, for me, some things that
it does are not needed. I mean checking the alignment of the source and
the type of destination. And after some headscratching I became even
more convinced that for the general case it would be much preferable
to write the fncpy() as regular function in .c file, not a macro, at
least to have the corresponding symbol in binary and let the assembler
code to call it, which is very probable.
