Sorry, but no.  None of this "mask bugs ... might" crap.  Either they're
bug fixes, or they aren't bug fixes.  This should be a definite decision,
not some vague crap.

If they're bug fixes, why the _hell_ aren't they queued for -rc kernels?

This sounds really screwed up to me, and it's no wonder that OMAP MMC got
broken if this is the kind of thing that's going on.
