This series adds device tree support for omap hsmmc
driver. The series is currently based on my patch
series[1] to add dt support for twl-regulators, since
hsmmc requires regulators to work.
I have also pulled the patch from Thomas Abraham which
adds mmc host controller bindings[2]
'mmc: Add OF bindings support for mmc host controller capabilities'

The series currently adds supports for only omap4-panda and
omap4-sdp boards and uses auxdata to pass platform specific
function pointers to the driver.

All the dependent patches along with this series can be found here
git://gitorious.org/omap-pm/linux.git for-dt/regulator-i2c-twl-mmc

regards,
Rajendra

  mmc: Add additional binding for mmc host controller
  mmc: omap: adapt the hsmmc driver to device tree
  omap4: mmc: Pass SoC and board data for omap4 mmc from dt
  omap4: mmc: use auxdata to pass platform function ptrs
