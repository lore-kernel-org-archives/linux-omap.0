Well, I do agree that the current DT support for EDMA is incomplete
without this patch even if there are no in-kernel users of it. I will
try sending this for the next -rc if we get to the final version in time
and after that its upto the upstreams to take it.

This has got nothing to do with edma probe order.

Looks fine to me.

We don't write future proof code in that _hope_ that it will get used
someday.  In fact this will confuse the reader into wondering if support
for second channel controller is present or not as the code will send
mixed messages. In short, we aim for consistency with situation today,
not tomorrow.

Besides, I can bet that when second CC support does get added, it is
very unlikely that the CC number is get encoded into channel number when
using DT.

Thanks,
Sekhar
