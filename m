Calling runtime PM API for every block causes serious perf hit to
crypto operations that are done on a long buffer.
As crypto is performed on a page boundary, encrypting large buffers can
cause a series of crypto operations divided by page. The runtime PM API
is also called those many times.

We call runtime_pm_get_sync only at beginning on the session (cra_init)
and runtime_pm_put at the end. This result in upto a 50% speedup as below.
This doesn't make the driver to keep the system awake as runtime get/put
is only called during a crypto session which completes usually quickly.

Before:
root@beagleboard:~# time -v openssl speed -evp aes-128-cbc
Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 16 size blocks: 13310 aes-128-cbc's in 0.01s
Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 64 size blocks: 13040 aes-128-cbc's in 0.04s
Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 256 size blocks: 9134 aes-128-cbc's in 0.03s
Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 1024 size blocks: 8939 aes-128-cbc's in 0.01s
Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 8192 size blocks: 4299 aes-128-cbc's in 0.00s

After:
root@beagleboard:~# time -v openssl speed -evp aes-128-cbc
Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 16 size blocks: 18911 aes-128-cbc's in 0.02s
Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 64 size blocks: 18878 aes-128-cbc's in 0.02s
Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 256 size blocks: 11878 aes-128-cbc's in 0.10s
Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 1024 size blocks: 11538 aes-128-cbc's in 0.05s
Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 8192 size blocks: 4857 aes-128-cbc's in 0.03s

While at it, also drop enter and exit pr_debugs, in related code. tracers
can be used for that.

Tested on a Beaglebone (AM335x SoC) board.

v2 changes:
Refreshed patch on kernel v3.10-rc3
v3 changes:
Included Acks in commit message
