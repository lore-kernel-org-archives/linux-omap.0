Great thanks for doing that. Also gave this series a try here
with my off idle MMC SDIO WLAN card test and things still work
for me. That's not really testing the PBIAS regulator though,
but a good torture test for saving and restoring context. So
FWIW:

Tested-by: Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>

If you need a PM torture test for PBIAS regulator, you could try
to do the following on your beagle xm MMC card with
oamp2plus_defconfig:

1. Make sure EHCI modules are not loaded and OTG USB cable is
   not connected

2. Enable UART timeouts and off idle with something like:

!/bin/bash

uarts=$(find /sys/class/tty/tty[SO]*/device/power/ -type d)
for uart in $uarts; do
        echo 3000 > $uart/autosuspend_delay_ms 2>&1
done

modprobe leds-gpio
modprobe ledtrig-default-on

uarts=$(find /sys/class/tty/tty[SO]*/power/ -type d 2>/dev/null)
for uart in $uarts; do
        echo enabled > $uart/wakeup 2>&1
        echo auto > $uart/control 2>&1
done

echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/pm_debug/enable_off_mode

3. Make sure you start seeing core_pwrdm OFF count increasing
   with cat /sys/kernel/debug/pm_debug/count

MMC should keep on working when hitting idle, if not, something
is not saved or restored properly. And SDIO WLAN cards should
wake up the system and respond to ping if the wakeirq is
configured in the dts file for the MMC controller. At least
mwifiex_sdio cards work for this :)

Regards,

Tony
