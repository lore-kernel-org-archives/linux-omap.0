Which request() function do your refer to? The mmc_host_ops.request()
returns before the transfer is finished.
Apart from that, I would say yes. It's nice to have the same code path
for valid cookie and invalid cookie scenario.

Note that the host_cookie could be set but with an invalid value.
host driver:
1. validate cookie
2. if invalid cookie call pre_req()
3. run request
4. done -> if (has called pre_req() #2) -> call post_req().

A general fix would be to put this logic in mmc_wait_for_req() in
core.c, but at this level it's not possible to validate the cookie. In
the current implementation the host driver controls the cookie value.
