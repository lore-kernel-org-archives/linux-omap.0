There are the set of fixes that were sent initially as part
of [1].

These are mostly fixes w.r.t populating regulators in
mmc dt node. It was working before because the regulators
connecting to the IO lines are always on regulators. This will
break once we add UHS support where voltage has to be changed
dynamically.

Performed enumeration testing on dra72-evm-revc, dra72-evm,
dra7-evm, am572x-evm, am571x-idk and am572x-idk.

This is a preparation series for adding UHS mode support in
the above mentioned platforms.
