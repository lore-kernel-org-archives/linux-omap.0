Hi,

Correcting a typo in the LKML address..

The gpio_chip name + gpio offset is coming from pdata until things
are converted over to use DT.

For DT, this should not be needed, this is needed for removing callbacks
in pdata so we can clean up some drivers and keep them working with
both pdata and DT until things are converted over to DT.

That comes from the bus code, will take a look.

I think so, this too comes from the bus code.
