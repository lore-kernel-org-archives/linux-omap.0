Hi Adrian,

Is there any use case or a valid scenario  whether to use
omap_hsmmc_ps_ops or omap_hsmmc_ops ?
I meant using power_saving option and without power_saving option

Ideally I feel having omap_hsmmc_ps_ops as default with or without
CONFIG_PM would be better as it internally has a state handling.

Regards,
Kishore
