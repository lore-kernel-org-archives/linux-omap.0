Neither the _allow or _forbid are needed,   _enable and _disable are en=
ough.

The _get is fine here, it's the _put that may be the problem.

Based on that thread you mentioned, it is the using of _put and
_put_sync in the suspend path that is the problem.  Basically, use of
runtime PM calls in the suspend/resume path is not recommended and not
guaranteed to work.   It currently works on OMAP, but I may have to
change this.

=46or now, what is certain is that runtime PM calls in the suspend
callbacks must be the _sync versions.  I'm still working on how to
properly implement the PM domain part for OMAP to correctly implement
the restrictions that the linux-pm maintainers want to enforce.
