The driver doesn't but RX-51 does, which is why the code is in the RX-51
board file.  We know exactly the use cases and the effect on performance.

It is unreasonable to override the policy decisions of the board maker
as defined in their board files.

Instead you must remove the omap_pm_set_min_mpu_freq() function entirely
or suffer the consequence that it can be used. i.e. it should not exist
if you don't want anyone to use it.

Many different constraints were tried.  min_mpu_freq was the only one that
worked.

In the future, improvements to DMA and changes to PM may be able to get the
same performance without the min_mpu_freq constraint.
