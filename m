Okay, how do we want to handle this patch?  I don't think there's any
urgency for this patch at the present time, so I'm quite happy for this
to be delayed after the next merge window after we have the pre-requisits
for it in place.  (And trying to get it in earlier is only going to give
us git tree dependencies to deal with.)
