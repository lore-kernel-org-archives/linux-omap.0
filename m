Yes I can see that being a problem. The fact that omap_hsmmc does
not fail back to PIO mode is just strange. We've had the omap1
drivers/mmc/host/omap.c work with and without DMA no problem,
no idea why this would not be required also for omap_hsmmc too.

Yes please. And also let's set up a new bug in bugzilla.kernel.org
for this.
