Thanks for the detailed explanation.
But pm_runtime_disable() is called in the error path, so shouldn't
it prevent the driver callbacks from being called ? (The docuementation
talks about disable_depth field, but it doesn't sound right that runtime
pm would be enabled before _probe() is called. So disable_depth should
be 1 when pm_runtime_disable is called in _probe error path, right ?)

Ok. I'll let Chris decide on this - DMA engine is not yet in Linus's tree
though.
