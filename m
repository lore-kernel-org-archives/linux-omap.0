This series adds UHS, HS200, DDR mode and ADMA support to
omap_hsmmc driver used to improve the throughput of MMC/SD in dra7
SoCs.

The functionality implemented in this series was sent before ([1]) but
was never followed up since supporting high speed modes in dra7 required
IODelay values to be configured. With IODelay driver being merged into
kernel, sending it as a fresh series with support for configuring IODelay
values.

Suggestions of migrating to sdhci driver (from omap_hsmmc driver) is not
addressed since
*) tuning ratio of MMC in dra7 is different from sdhci
*) IOdelay is required for dra7
*) GPIO based card detect is not supported in sdhci
*) Some of the registers don't always have correct values as in sdhci
   (like PSTATE).
Supporting all of these in sdhci will result in adding lot of quirks in
sdhci driver.

This series has been tested on beagleboard, pandaboard, beaglebone-black,
beaglebone, am335x-evm, am437x-evm, dra7xx-evm, dra72x-evm, am571x-idk
and am572x-idk.

I can split the series to go into Ulf Hansson's tree and Tony's tree 
separately if that is required.
