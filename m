Bummer, sounds like some duplicate work could have been avoided :(
I suggest resend to Chris and linux-mmc one more time as Chris should
pick up the MMC patches in general.

I've been just trying to get things working in general for v3.13-rc
series for omaps with device tree based booting and patching all over
the place. This is to make it easy for us to just drop the legacy
platform based booting for v3.14 while keeping things working.

Chris, as far as I'm concerned, Aaro and Jarkko are good people to
review and ack the drivers/mmc/omap.c patches, so adding Aaro to
Cc as well.

Regards,

Tony
