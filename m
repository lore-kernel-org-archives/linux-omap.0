Pardon my ignorance, but why would runtime suspend be called for a
device whose probe has failed ? AFAIK, MMC stack wouldn't make
the _enable()/disable() calls, which call runtime PM APIs, unless the
probe is successful.
 Is there a stacktrace for the offending caller ?

Can you please let me know which commit introduced this problem
in the first place ? There were not many changes in MMC PM code
in this merge window.
