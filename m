Yes, you're right.  

I'm getting a few different problems mixed together here.  To work on a
different problem, I had commented out the pm_runtime_disable() call in
the error path and so I was seeing the callbacks being called even on
probe failure.  Withe the pm_runtime_disable() added back, that doesn't
happen.

However, there is another case where the runtime PM callbacks may be
called: the PM domain code in omap_device can still attempts to call the
runtime PM callbacks during late suspend for devices that are not
already runtime suspended.  This is done even when there is no driver
bound to a device, but this is a bug in the omap_device code, not in the
MMC driver.  So I'll be sending a patch shortly to fix that.

So, all that to say, this patch can be dropped.

Thanks for the detailed review.

Kevin
