Agreed.

Yes please.

That does not work unfortunately :( We are now stuck in a situation
where two drivers are attempting to probe with the same compatible
and we can't enable 8250_OMAP because of the user space breakage
with the device names. And I'm actuallly thinking we should add a
new compatible for 8250-omap to be able to start enabling it one
board at a time.

It's best to enable devices to use the new compatible as things are
tested rather than hope for some magic "flag day" flip that might
never happen. Having two days attempting to probe with the same
binding just won't work.

So yeah, I agree with Kishon that we should stick with generic
and sdhci bindings. And then we can start already using it for
boards that can use it, then eventually when we're ready, start
parsing also the legacy bindings and maybe drop the old driver.

Tony
