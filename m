That's very nice!

According to the implementation in sdhci_set_power_noreg(), I
understand it as the SDHCI_POWER_CONTROL register actually controls
the power to the card (VDD) and the not the I/O voltage level
(ios->signal_voltage).

However, if I read the SDHCI spec, it seems to be mentioning the "SD
bus voltage", which to me is about the I/O voltage level. So either
the spec is unclear or the code is wrong. :-)

Are you saying that the omap_hsmmc variant is using the
SDHCI_POWER_CONTROL to control the I/O voltage level?

I am wondering how other variants use it. Perhaps most variants
actually have an external regulator and thus calls
sdhci_set_power_reg() instead.

Looping in Adrian, to see if he has some thoughts on this.

Kind regards
Uffe
