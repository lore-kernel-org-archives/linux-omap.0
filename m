Is that the only problem? Presumably, the SD driver doesn't have a 
userspace facing issue.

Aren't you just picking whether the flag day is in DT or the kernel? I 
guess you're assuming one kernel build and it would be switching all 
boards at one.

I assume there are some other common properties you would switch to in 
the transition?  You could make the legacy driver bail from probe based 
on presence or absence of other properties. Or you could just blacklist 
converted platforms in the legacy driver. The point is that the problems 
are solvable in the kernel.

But if your really want a new compatible, I don't really care. It's 
only one device.
