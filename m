Well, but the driver doesn't flush its buffers automatically, it caches 
data until it has sufficient amount available. So, assuming you want to 
do this:

sham_init
   sham_update 256 bytes
   sham_update 256 bytes
   wait until two above updates are complete
   sham_export

... the execution hangs at the wait phase as the driver is still waiting 
for more data to cache, and will never complete the two update requests. 
Currently, the driver is written in such way that it waits until it has 
enough data cached before starting to push it out to hardware, or waits 
until sham_final to be called. Pushing out small pieces of data causes 
severe performance degradation on the driver, as setting up the DMA 
operation itself is rather costly.

Either way, flush for the buffers is needed, I wonder if automatic flush 
should be added also based on some timer.
