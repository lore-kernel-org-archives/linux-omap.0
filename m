Looking at MMCI, are you sure all those DMA engine terminate calls are
correct?

=46or example, why are we terminating all DMA engine transfers in the
post request function?  Surely that should've already been taken care
of by the driver before it told the core that the request was completed=
=2E
If the post request function is called for the previous request, meanwh=
ile
the next request is in flight, terminating the DMA engine transfer will
cause invalid state in the driver.

Basically, this looks completely buggered.  I think you need to review
your changes with a thought to what happens logically with DMA and the
MMC host drivers whenever an error occurs.
