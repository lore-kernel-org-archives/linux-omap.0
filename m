Hi Vignesh,

Generally I don't like this patch, it will make it harder, not easier,
to maintain the omap hsmmc driver. Also given that the bug occurs
rarely, people will be reluctant to clean it up later or accept
patches.

ok, I see

what about clearing any pending transfer in
- mmc_gpio_cd_irqt, or
- mmc_detect_change

e.g. trigger the later mentioned .card_event callback from those
functions, instead mmc_rescan? Then you can install your
omap_hsmmc_request_clear as the card_event callback. This makes your
custom isr handler redundant, actually your isr handler became
standard.

I think we don't need a custom isr.
