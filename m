Hmm looks like here's a reasonably recent update that we've missed
from Jarkko Lavinen to update his email address:

http://lkml.org/lkml/2013/10/4/142

I've updated Jarkko Lavinen's address in this mail, we should
probably also patch the MAINTAINERS file for that, and then see if
Aaro and Jarkko Nikula are interested to be listed there as well.

Regards,

Tony
