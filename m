I agree, it should be a regulator for the MMC driver and that's what I
already suggested earlier. Having it as a regulator allows us to get
rid of all the non-standard before and after calls in the omap_hsmmc.c.
This way the omap_hsmmc.c code can handle the internal and external
voltages the same way.

The PBIAS for MMC1 is a mux + comparator for the MMC pin, so it makes
sense for the regulator driver to access the register via pinctrl API.
I think the reason why we have registers like this and the USB comparators
in the omap SCM (System Control Module) as the all seem to relate to
pin states.

Yes I agree, it should be a regulator for MMC. Doing it this way just
adds yet more code that's usable for only one of the omap MMC
controllers.

Yes. And it seems that the delays should not be needed, but instead
the comparator bits should be checked.
