What type of benchmarks would be appropriate to post ?
As you know, the response time of a card would vary depending on
whether the flash device
has enough empty blocks to write into and doesn't have to resort to GC =
during
write requests.
Macro benchmarks like iozone etc would be inappropriate here, as they w=
on't show
the latency effects of individual write requests hung up doing page
reclaim, which happens
once in a while.

I agree. But when writes are delayed anyway as it exceeds
hpi_time_threshold (the window
available for invoking HPI), it means that the device is in GC mode
and either read or write
could be equally delayed.  Note that even in case of interrupting a
write, a single block write
(which usually is too short to be interrupted, as designed) is
sufficient for doing a page reclaim,
and further write requests (including multiblock) would not be subject
to HPI, as they will
complete within the average time.
