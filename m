Hope you are referring CONFIG_RTC_DRV_TWL92330 to omap3_defconfig
and not to omap_4430sdp_defconfig.

With omap_4430sdp_defconfig , I've tested on 4430SDP and Blaze and always
Cards on MMC1 & MMC2 gets detected once bootedup.

With omap3_defconfig  +  disabling "CONFIG_OMAP_RESET_CLOCKS",
I've tested on 4430SDP and Blaze and always Cards on MMC1 & MMC2
gets detected on bootup.

Following is the commit ID :1674c0ceabfb7726246989874bb4da7bcb55ea89
