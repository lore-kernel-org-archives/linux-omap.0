If it is possible to overheat the charger without tripping an internal fuse,
then sure the charger is mis-designed - is it not?

Can you suggest an algorithm for determining how much current can safely be
pulled from a charger that would *not* make you nervous?

Changed to dev_dbg() - thanks.

The current being measured and controlled is the current flowing in from the
USB VBUS, not flowing out to the battery.
So I the code choose 0.9A, that is all that will be drawn.

This is a possible issue similar to this though.
If the device is idle and the battery is fully charged, then it won't draw
much current from USB even if we allow it too.
So the algorithm might decide it is OK to draw 1.7A because at that time the
device cannot use more than 200mA, and that doesn't cause the voltage to dr=
op.

Then later when user enabled wifi-hotspot, the current needed might go up
above what the charger can provide.

Maybe I should only increase the limit while the actual current is also
increasing.  Maybe also revisit the setting when the battery starts chargin=
g.
