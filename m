No.  dma_mask is a pointer to u64.  You need it stored in some variable=
=2E

But, really, we shouldn't be initializing dma masks in drivers at all.
That's supposed to come from the point where devices are created - and
in the case of DMA engine stuff, its not the peripheral device structur=
es
which are doing DMA (they're DMA-incapable) - they rely on the services
of a separate IP to perform DMA on their behalf.
