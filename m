[ Upstream commit 37685f6a63eeca2135d1f704e7638409a071b1f6 ]

The PHY must add both tx and rx delay and not only on the tx clock.
The board uses AR8031_AL1A PHY where the rx delay is enabled by default,
the tx dealy is disabled.

The reason why rgmii-txid worked because the rx delay was not disabled by
the driver so essentially we ended up with rgmii-id PHY mode.
