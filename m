And for schedulers like no-op that don't do any read/write balancing?
Also, I thought the code was queuing such demand paged requests at
the front of the queues, too, so bypassing most of the read/write
balancing logic of the elevators...

Sure, but my point is that you are adding a flag that will be set
for all user data read IO, and then making it priviledged in the
lower layers.

And thereby stalling what might be writes critical to operation.
Indeed, how does this affect the system when it starts swapping
heavily? If you keep stalling writes, the system won't be able to
swap and free memory...

Yes, but seeing as the user has direct control of the pre-emption
vector, it's not hard to imagine someone using it for a timing
attack...

The problem is that the attribute you are setting covers every
single data read that is done by all users. If that's what you want
to have happen, then why do you even need a new flag at this layer?
Just treat every non-REQ_META read request as a demand paged IO and
you've got exactly the same behaviour without needing to tag at the
higher layer....

Dave.
