I don't like this patch as is, as it seems like you are replacing the
VMMC regulator that actually exist in HW by parsing a DT property.

I think mmc_of_parse_voltage() shall *only* be used when the OCR mask
(->ocr_avail) can't be fetched by using a regulator. Typically that's
when the VMMC voltage levels are managed within the mmc controller
itself.

I don't have a strong opinion on how you solve that, but I guess you
have two options.

1.
Make sure the driver can be build and used both for CONFIG_REGULATOR
and !CONFIG_REGULATOR. What you need to take care of then, is to
assign the ->ocr_avail mask to a default value in the case when it
can't be fetched from a regulator. Most mmc drivers has some kind of
fall-back mechanism like this.

For those SoC where you need/can control the VMMC regulator, make sure
those enables CONFIG_REGULATOR to get the proper behaviour by
omap_hsmmc.

2.
Force omap_hsmmc to be build with CONFIG_REGULATOR.

Kind regards
Uffe
