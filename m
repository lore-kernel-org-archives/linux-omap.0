Hi Matt!

At first thanks for you efforts on DMA Engine on AM33XX.

I cloned your github repository and did short testing with it. I get the 
following error when the kernel mounts my sd-card:

After that the filesystem on the sd-card has an error that I have to fix with 
e2fsck. As rootfs I use a nfsroot.
In my quick tests, same setup, I don't get any error on edma-dmaengine-
am33xx-v5 branch of your repository.
If you need any further information, let me now.

Regards,
Lars
