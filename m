Okay so the max sg_len should be done by setting the device_dma_parameters.

See the example in MXS DMA and MMC drivers

Now for second parameter why do you need that to be passed, I thought in edma the
clients needs this value somehow to program the channel. It would be good that
if we can delink from this and let edma derive. Also there should be no such
thing as max_sg, the driver should be able to perform any size of sg_list.
Internally it can be breaking the dma into multiple trasnactions.
