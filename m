There are very good reasons not to do this: that will result in
configurations where MMC_OMAP_HS was set but without REGULATOR_PBIAS
ending up with MMC_OMAP_HS being disabled.  That doesn't help the
root problem, which is "why has the kernel boot regressed for my
previous working configuration?"

The solution proposed here adds a message to the boot which points
out fair and square what needs to be done to rectify the boot
failure.  Adding a dependency just brings up the question "where
has my MMC driver gone?"
