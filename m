Great, this is the detail I was looking for since my MMC knowledge is
quite limited. =20

So, in theory, this same sleep command could be sent during runtime
suspend as well, so that a system suspend would not have to runtime
resume, correct?  But I suppose it would result in a much higher latenc=
y
runtime resumes.  It might be worth experimenting with doing this,
possibly in combination with longer auto-suspend delay times.

Thanks for the explanation,

Kevin
