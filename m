Good idea, how about something like the following? AFAIK that's the
only .config option needed as MFD_SYSCON is selected by Kconfig
already.

Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: ARM: List new omap MMC requirements

Earlier the PBIAS regulator was optional, not so with recent
omap_hsmmc changes. To make things easier for people with
custom .config files, let's add minimal documentation for it
as suggested by Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>.
