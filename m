I guess the reason to why this isn't implemented in host drivers is
either because such behaviour for SDIO cards hasn't been observed
(that's my case) or that it's kept as "hacks" in out of tree patches.

Have you really investigated that it's not the GPIO IRQ that's not
been properly configured?

Okay, so it seems like your assumption is correct. We need a way to
switch to 1-bit when host drivers is about to enter runtime PM suspend
state.

They are allowed to sleep unless the have set pm_runtime_irq_safe(). I
don't think any of the mmc drivers are configured as such.

I would prefer not.

I don't like the MMC_CLKGATE thing, since it just add complexity to
the mmc core for things that I think should be handled through runtime
PM instead.

That will hit performance for each and every SDIO request. To me this
is not an option.
