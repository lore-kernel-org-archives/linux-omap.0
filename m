Linus probably knows more here, but I have a vague recollection of
the MMC bounce buffer code being needed mostly for performance
reasons: when the scatterlist is discontiguous, that can result in
a request being split up into separate MMC commands, which due
to the lack of queued commands combined with the need for
garbage collection on sub-page writes results in a huge slowdown
compared to having larger bounce buffers all the time.

We had discussed finding a different way to do this (separate
from the bounce buffering), but I don't know if that ever happened,
or if this is even the code that you are changing here.
