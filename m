Unfortunately I don't know how many of us are using this specific
platform with the latest kernel, so not much testing is done.

To me it has been very serious.  I had to revert a bunch of patches to
be able to continue working with the mainline.  It took me a while to
see the bug because I've been away during the 3.6 cycle.

I think one of the reasons not many people use the mainline with TWL is
exactly because something seems to break on every new kernel release.
I'm one of those who care and report things when I see them.

I think saying that it is not important because only one person reported
it is not a good excuse.  I would at least have liked seeing an answer
saying, "this can't be fixed because of this and that" or "can you try
to fix it by doing this or that".
