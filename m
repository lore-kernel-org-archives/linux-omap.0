The reset values for all the PCF lines are high and hence on shutdown
we should drive all the lines high in order to bring it to the reset state.

This is actually required since pcf doesn't have a reset line and even after
warm reset (by invoking "reboot" in prompt) the pcf lines maintains it's
previous programmed state. This becomes a problem if the boards are designed
to work with the default initial state.

DRA7XX_evm uses PCF8575 and one of the PCF output lines feeds to MMC/SD and
this line should be driven high in order for the MMC/SD to be detected.
This line is modelled as regulator and the hsmmc driver takes care of enabling
and disabling it. In the case of 'reboot', during shutdown path as part of it's
cleanup process the hsmmc driver disables this regulator. This makes MMC boot
not functional.

Fixed it by driving high all the pcf lines.
