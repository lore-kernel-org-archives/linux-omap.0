Both sub ms and long duration timers are needed, based on the type of operation.
The eMMC standard has evolved to define new commands which require
such long duration
operations. The short ("control") commands do need high precision.

I'll certainly look into this. One way is to use the IP timer for
short commands and
deferrable timers for long ones - but I reckon it would be messy.

I've actually put this patch on hold - as someone pointed out to me that
this violates some sections of eMMC spec.
