Do you have one of these BUG_ON() traces handy, so we can perhaps see
where local interrupts got disabled?

Yes, before removing the BUG_ON() it would be most helpful to
understand why it was added.

Hopefully the email still works..  Juha, do you recall why you added
the BUG_ON(irqs_disabled()) to mmc_omap_start_request()?
