Yes, that's part of my point.

So the argument is that if really_probe() called dpm_move_last()
immediately before the dev->bus->probe()/drv->probe() call then there
is a race condition that G could get both registered and probed before
D's probe() starts using G's resources.  And so, the list would still
have G after D which is in the wrong order.  Do I understand
correctly?

Agreed, after probe returns is definitely too late.

I suspect this gets messy in a hurry, but perhaps it is worth trying.
So, any device that makes use of a PHY, GPIO line, codec, etc will
need to call dpm_move_last() before adding child devices, correct?
I'd be much happier to find a way to do this in core code though.  And
there is still a potential race condition here.  For example, if G is
in the middle of it's probe routine, and D gets probed between G
registering GPIOs and calling dpm_move_last(), then we're in the same
boat again.  I think the window for this race can be considered to be
of the same magnitude as the moved to early race described above.  I
need to think about this more...
