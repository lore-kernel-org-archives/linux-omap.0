However, it does have to be a static value as it's at device level,
rather than per-channel or per-request.  If it is set dynamically
by a request submission, it could vary wildly depending on the burst
and address width of the last request submitted to DMA engine, and
so the parameter becomes meaningless.

Consider what would happen to the value if we had one channel being
used with burst=32 addr_width=4 and another channel also being used
simultaneously with burst=8 addr_width=1...
