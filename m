Hi Madhu,
 Thanks to your hard work and maintenance of OMAP MMC & good luck to
whatever you plan to do after this!!
=46or this patch, NAK :-)
It would be better to just change the status to 'Orphaned' than
deleting the entire section.
I hope that someone will step up to maintain it shortly..

Best regards,
Venkat.
