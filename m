I created a sdhci variant and was able to get it working with high speed mode
in dra7.

I have a query on sdhci_set_power_noreg() in sdhci.c. sdhci_set_power_noreg
sets SDHCI_POWER_CONTROL based on *vdd* value. However SDHCI_POWER_CONTROL is
for setting bus voltage and need not be based on *vdd*. IMHO
SDHCI_POWER_CONTROL should be set based on "ios->signal_voltage".

Let me know if my understanding is wrong.

Thanks
Kishon
