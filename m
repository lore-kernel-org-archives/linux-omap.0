Does this driver make use of this platform data?

If so, it needs converting to DMA engine _before_ this patch (which is
one reason why its a good idea to do these changes as separate patches...
as I've done.)  It means stuff like this can be slotted in as necessary
in the patch order.

I'm told that driver is OMAP2 only - I don't have any OMAP2 platforms to
be able to test it on (I only have OMAP3 and OMAP4.)
