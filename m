DTS changes are fine to merge as is separately, some crypto 
functionality might not work properly though (well, the support is 
somewhat broken on am43xx/dra7 anyways.) I just gave the kernel a boot 
test with am43xx/dra7 platforms with the DT data only applied, and that 
part worked fine.

I noticed that if you merge the hwmod changes before you have the DTS 
data though, you will get some extra boot warnings of the following kind 
on am43xx/dra7:

<snip>
[    0.315623] omap_hwmod: aes1: no dt node
[    0.315631] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[    0.315656] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at 
arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap_hwmod.c:2497 _init+0x1d0/0x41c
[    0.315663] omap_hwmod: aes1: doesn't have mpu register target base
<snip>

Do you want to pick-up the DTS changes from this revision of series as 
is or shall I repost those also? I think the series would require a 
re-ordering of posting the DTS changes before the hwmod data.
