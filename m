Yes - The issue is not an issue with the set_data_timeout function but =
the
_first_ access to MMC IP register blocks after enabling the mmc_host.
(This backtrace signature is very common during MMC-PM hackathons )
  But I have not seen any difference if the access is read or write..
Will check again..

As you might have guessed, the test setup is not accessible for me and =
it's not
a simulated environment or scripted test. I'll try to check if some tes=
tcases
can be written to simulate this.
