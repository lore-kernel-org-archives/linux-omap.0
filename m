Yes some kind of generic approach is needed too, at least for some
drivers. The above API makes sense to me, sounds like you might
have a PM runtime patch coming along those lines?

These are not revision registers, here the driver configured values
are saved in PM runtime suspend, and then restored in resume.
We are already doing the same for GPIO for example. In these cases the
context loss count is not needed AFAIK.

With some hardware it is of course possible that the power cycle is so
short that the hardare is stuck in a limbo state and for those cases
keeping track of the context loss via PM runtime.
