It is not really a regulator, CONTROL_PBIAS_LITE is just a register
in control module which configures pad/pin on SOC. In this case PBIAS cells
are powered down before any voltage changes and after the external voltage
supplied to VDDS_MMC of OMAP stabilizes pbias cells  is powered ON again
with specific Voltage which is given to OMAP for MMC io pins

For OMAP2430, OMAP3430 It additionally has a bit for speed mode control
which are set always (static config)

I am quoting pbias register field description from TRM for reference

BIT2 PBIASSPEEDCTRL0 Speed Control for MMC I/O
0b0 => 26 MHz I/O max speed
0b1 => 52 MHz I/O max speed

BIT26 MMC1_PWRDNZ PWRDNZ control to MMC1 IO
This bit is used to protect the MMC1 I/O cell when
SDMMC1_VDDS is not stable.
0x0: Software must clear this bit when SDMMC1_VDDS
changes.
0x1: Software must set this bit only when
SDMMC1_VDDS is stable.

BIT25 MMC1_PBIASLITE_HIZ_MODE HIZ_MODE from MMC1 PBIASLITE
0x0: PBIAS in normal operation mode
0x1: PBIAS output is in high impedence state

BIT24 MMC1_PBIASLITE_SUPPLY_HI SUPPLY_HI_OUT from MMC1 PBIASLITE
_OUT Read 0x0: SDMMC1_VDDS = 1.8V
Read 0x1: SDMMC1_VDDS = 3V

BIT23 MMC1_PBIASLITE_VMODE_ER VMODE ERROR from MMC1 PBIASLITE
ROR Read 0x0: VMODE level is same as SUPPLY_HI_OUT
Read 0x1: VMODE level is not same as
SUPPLY_HI_OUT

BIT22 MMC1_PBIASLITE_PWRDNZ PWRDNZ control to MMC1 PBIASLITE
This bit is used to protect the MMC1_PBIAS cell (MMC1
I/O cell associated) when SDMMC1_VDDS is not stable.
0x0: Software must clear this bit when SDMMC1_VDDS
changes.
0x1: Software must set this bit only when
SDMMC1_VDDS is stable.

BIT21 MMC1_PBIASLITE_VMODE VMODE control to MMC1 PBIASLITE
0x0: SDMMC1_VDDS = 1.8V
0x1: SDMMC1_VDDS = 3V

the only other user for pbias which I can find is USB pin configuration in
arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-omap3logic.c where it is statically programmed for 3V
which can be modeled as well as  default pinctrl state.

You mean regulator via pinctrl APIs, I think It will just move the code
from omap_hsmmc to a new regulator file with it own init data for pinctrl.

Not sure if Regulator maintainer will agree to it.

Moreover what I needs is three different states 0V, 0 to 1.8V, 3 V to 3.3V
not 0, 1.8V, 3V. plus pbias register fields got moved around between omap3, omap4
and omap5, That was one of the reason for moving to pinctrl states.

It thought pinctrl-single,bits in pinctrl-single.c is introduced
precisely for such misc control register which has bit configuration
affecting different module i/o pads.

But, Not all OMAP has such support to read comparator bits.
