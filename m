In my testing it wasn't called from softirq, I'm using cryptodev which is
called from openssl through ioctl, here is a traceback (sorry about wrap):

[<bf8010bb>] (cryptodev_ioctl+0x282/0x59c [cryptodev])

Could you suggest, what other place is update() called in softirq context?
I may be missing something.

Thanks,
