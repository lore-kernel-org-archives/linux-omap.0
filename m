Read the commit message. ;)

They're there (and removed by the next patch) so that the driver can
be easily switched between DMA engine and the private DMA API.  Simply
change the relevant #if to zero at build time.

I don't think it warrants config symbols or trying to do it via module
params as its just a stepping stone through the process.
