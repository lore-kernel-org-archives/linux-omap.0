What block size are you using?  It looks like you're using something
less than 512. I've checked the spec again and the DMA packet size
should be the block size in words (and not the FIFO depth).

Also, keep in mind that the buffers for transfers must begin and end on
a word boundary.  The OMAP's DMA controller can only transfer whole
words to the MMC FIFO.
