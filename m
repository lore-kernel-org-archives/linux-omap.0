Yes, this would be the real clean way. But ...

... most probably we have to find a workaround until (if ever?) above 
clean implementation is available.

What we need is after SDIO mode and bus width is known, and before the 
first interrupt comes, to set IBG.

Yes, this seems to be exactly the problem John reports in his follow 
up mail.

Any hint how to clear SDIO interrupt?

Many thanks
