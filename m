Platforms like (AM335x) needed this bit to be set in order to sustain high
speed transfers. This was concluded after HSMMC IP timing closure was 
completed for High speed Cards. 

This was confirmed on high speed cards with very low setup/hold delay (in the 
order of nsec) was tested. For AM335x, this bit was to be set to meet setup 
requirement and hold requirement for MMC/SD HS cards.

There are chances that the platform is not supporting Clock output from HSMMC
IP greater than 25 MHz even if the card is High Speed. So it would be better 
to check host->fclk than ios->clock. 

Kindly correct me if I am wrong.
