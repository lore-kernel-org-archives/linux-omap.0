Ah, clumsy mistake, I'll fix it and resubmit.

When booting up, I see the first set of timeouts (CMD8 and CMD5), but
I don't get any timeouts on 55, and it starts up correctly for me,
detecting my SD card and mounting it.  I've got an Angstrom
installation on my SD card and can boot all the way into it with this
patch.

Not sure if it matters, but this is against the linux-omap for-next bra=
nch.
