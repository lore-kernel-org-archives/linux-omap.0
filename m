The VCM ensures that all mappings that map a given physical buffer:
IOMMU mappings, CPU mappings and one-to-one device mappings all map
that buffer using the same (or compatible) attributes. At this point
the only attribute that users can pass is CACHED. In the absence of
CACHED all accesses go straight through to the physical memory.

The architecture of the VCM allows these sorts of consistency checks
to be made since all mappers of a given physical resource are
tracked. This is feasible because the physical resources we're
tracking are typically large.
