above has been merged, 89269ef1f0abc72c551198123e19cd4edfd43cf4
but I am missing the patches below in mainline (3.6-rc3) -- what happened?

as Javier pointed out in https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1203391/, 
MMC is broken support e.g. on beagleboard unless DMA_OMAP is defined

I suggest to take below patches and help to avoid some extra gray hair for 
people looking for a fix for non-booting beagleboards

thanks, p.
