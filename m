Looks like it's some kind of race between the slots that now gets triggered
in the omap driver.

Commenting out the second slot in the board file fixes things. I tried adding
a mutex to protect the sequence between POWER_UP and POWER_ON, but no luck yet.

Also adding printk statements here and there makes it work again.
