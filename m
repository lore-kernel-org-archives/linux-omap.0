Can't the mmc core show the reason once, and not require each and every
individual driver to show/say the same thing?  All a driver needs to
know is if it worked or didn't work.  Every time it didn't work, it
needs to unwind stuff and then recover properly.

The drivers do not do different things based on what type of error
happened, as they don't care at all.

So I strongly suggest leaving it simple, as it is today, as this makes
drivers simpler, they don't have to duplicate the same type of error
reporting all over the place, and it's easy to audit for.

It also makes it so that large patchsets that touch every driver like
this are not needed at all.

I think we need to get rid of more of the ERR_PTR() stuff, as again,
it's useless.  All we need to know is an error happened, that's it.

Again, no, it makes more work for the different drivers, duplicates code
all over the place, and really doesn't help any user, or developer, out
at all.

Just have the mmc core properly log what went wrong, and all should be
fine.

Again, keep it simple, that's the best policy for the kernel, and
really, most software :)
