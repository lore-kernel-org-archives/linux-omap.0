You *need* Lee Jones and Mark Brown to review this.
Maybe Laurent has something to add too.

Ux500 had the very same thing, and there this was solved using
a GPIO regulator for "vqmmc" a level-shifter. I vaguely remember
Laurent doing something similar with the SH stuff.

So why does the pin control API control bias voltage?

This seem so intuitively wrong as it can possibly get, clearly this
is regulator territory.

This also looks strange from an MMC point of view.

It just seems these bits in these registers should be poked at
by the regulator world, not the pinctrl world. That the bits are
in the middle of pinctrl things does not really matter.

And the regulator framework supports power-on delays.
