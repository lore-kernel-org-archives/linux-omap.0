Hi,

I'm trying to figure out why when randomly booting our system after it =
have been hard shutdown for some time (couple of minutes to couple of =
days) doesn't boot with MMC error?=20

WORKAROUND:
Rebooting the system most of the time remove the issue.

I try couple of version of Kernel from stable 3.2.47 & 3.4.53 without =
success.
I try to change FS from EXT3 to EXT4 without success.
I try multiple SD..

Any proposition of test that you think that is worth trying, I'm willing =
to try.

Your opinions will really be appreciated,

See below for some output of my environment,

ps: My intention are to enable CONFIG_MMC_DEBUG? Try kernel 3.10.1?
