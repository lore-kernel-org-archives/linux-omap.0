I think so, since those 3 newer registers are not documented for all platforms.
Not sure whether it is valid in those cases where it is not documented.

Since capa register has these info and can be
applied uniformly across all paltforms, I feel reading capa register is the
way to go. Do you still think there is a need for new api with no offset ?

Do you have the numbers ?
Is it for read or write,
how large should the transfer size be ?

I couldn't get any performance improvements with this patch series,
Could you please share your test setup, may be I am missing something.
