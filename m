Glad to see this happening!

No luck here though, after a quick test I'm getting the following with MMC
not working:

zoom3
[    2.277160] omap_hsmmc omap_hsmmc.1: unable to obtain RX DMA engine channel 48
[    2.284729] omap_hsmmc omap_hsmmc.2: unable to obtain RX DMA engine channel 78
[    2.292999] omap_hsmmc omap_hsmmc.0: unable to obtain RX DMA engine channel 62

[    2.500488] omap_hsmmc omap_hsmmc.1: unable to obtain RX DMA engine channel 48

And leaving out patch 7/8 produces similar errors for both rx and tx, but MMC
works without DMA:

n900
