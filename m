Ok.

Yes, that is what I had in mind. Let's see what others think about the two
options.

I would also avoid the 'struct dma_filter' entirely by using a zero-terminated
list and passing the filter function and map table separately, but your approach
seems reasonable as well.

In my initial suggestion, the idea was to do the registration of the filter map
separately from registering the dmaengine device to give us a little more
flexibility in converting existing code, but it requires listing both the
dmaengine device and the slave devname in the map, so your approach is probably
better in the long run even if it requires a little more work for doing the
conversion.
