Looks like there's a different handling in the MMC driver
for no_regulator_off_init that's needed for eMMC. That needs to
be sorted out and tested first.

The old bindings must be supported. It's not like we can just drop
them. We should just keep the old binding and parse it the same way
as the generic binding. That's a minimal amount of code.

After the issue with no_regulator_off_init has been solved, then
we can naturally update the existing .dts files to use the generic
binding.

Tony
