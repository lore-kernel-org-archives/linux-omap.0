IMHO this is a bit overkill solution for our problem.

SPI is using these spi_board_info tables to populate the SPI device
trees. These tables are registered early at the board-specific init
code, and are later used by SPI core to populate the devices when the
SPI master controller is registered.

SDIO doesn't normally needs any kind of hard coded data: most devices
are dynamically probed and populated.

On rare cases like the wl1271, we have some platform-specific data we
need to deliver the SDIO function driver (i.e. the irq info in this
case). Since the device is hardwired to a specific controller, it does
make some sense to pass this private data from the controller's info
in the board files, through the host driver, and make it accessible
through the specific host instance that drives this controller.

Btw, if our problem was be broader (e.g., needs to supply private data
for non-hardwired devices), then I agree that a more complex
mechanism, such as the one you suggest, would be needed. But currently
the problem is very simple and the solution is even simpler: just add
1 private pointer to the host.

Hope you find this reasonable,

Thanks,
Ohad.
