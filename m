Thanks for the pointer, but wondering why is it named as gpio-regulator
and how it is different from fixed-regulator.
After going through git log description, I understand that voltage/current level
for a particular regulator is controlled by a set of pad/pin on the POWER IC
and pad/pin may be usually connected to gpio pins if it is needs to be
configurable and ground/pulled for constant voltage.

Collection of gpios logic level are modeled as state for particular voltage.
But gpio is not used in my case.
