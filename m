Yes, I would very welcome that, since it would free the omap_hsmmc of the
'protection' mechanism that makes the driver clumsy. But as an initial step
separating cover from card detect already seems enough for this series.
Another thought was, that since only one platform is using it, the prospect of
getting it merged into the core was minimal.

Oh sorry, seems I was unclear. I definitely do not want to revert that patch
permanently, the opposite is true, I very much welcome it. Thanks for your work
by the way.
I only reverted it temporarily so I could test that the card detect
logic still works
with legacy board files, non-device-tree platforms. But since mmc_of_parse is
setting the card detect pin, my changes could not be tested with my
device-tree platform (bbone). So I reverted the above patch only for testing,
afterwards I rebased the patches on top of it, before submitting
