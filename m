Agreed  and followed the changes mostly but made some more changes on t=

I agree just having the 3 functions makes it work.

=46ew Comments below:

1) In the above function, initializing "card_detect"  in the driver as
done in omap_hsmmc_gpio_init might be more readable and this has been
done in nongpio_init instead.
Even having initialization of  "card_detect_irq" inside nongpio_init is=
 fine.

2)Also calling omap_hsmmc_gpio_init in case of a card detect line
which is not GPIO
doesn't make sense though it assigns -EINVAL to switch_pin in case of
invalid GPIO
which is intended for a non-removable card .

3) And also having some thing like GPIO and NON_GPIO flag to
distinguish might make sense.

Kishore
