I think the issue is that until we have a SCM driver module setting
up the PBIAS register as a regulator, eMMC cards won't work without
ti,non-removable.

Hey it's an ABI :)

But before doing that, we first must fix the issue for still
needing ti,non-removable.

Hmm yeah maybe that should be discussed separately on the
device tree mailing list.
