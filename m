No it is independent of CONFIG_PM

With CONFIG_PM
	- the driver will restore registers if the host controller
	has been powered off / on by PRCM
	- suspend / resume can be used

No it is independent of CONFIG_PM

Without CONFIG_PM
	- card will be put to sleep after 1 second
	- card will be powered off after another 8 seconds

Nothing should need to be removed.

With power_saving it is yes.

It should work in all cases.
