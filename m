Sure, I'll add that as well.

Sure, looks like of_dma_request_slave_channel does same thing in
drive/dma/of-dma.c. Let me follow up with a patch that does it this way=
=2E
I agree its cleaner.

Actually those line breaks are not necessary and wouldn't result in
compilation errors. I was planning to drop them. I'll go ahead and spli=
t
it out anyway, now that also the OF version of the function is going to
be bit longer if we use the of_parse functions.

Thanks for your review,
