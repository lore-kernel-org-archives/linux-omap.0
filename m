Can you enlighten me what's the proper way to get patches to mmc since
I cannot figure out working methodology from MAINTAINERS file?

I happened to notice that Tony had this similar patch in linux-omap
list I sent first time already September to you and linux-mmc (sorry
linux-omap folks, I didn't want to spam multiple lists):

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mmc/msg22137.html

After that I've resend the set a few times including a fix to
user triggable NULL pointer dereference:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mmc/msg22610.html

I'm fine if mmc patches should go through other subsystems but at least
it should be documented in MAINTAINERS file.
