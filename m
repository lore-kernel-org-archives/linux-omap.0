Is this the patch that fixes this issue:

	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mmc/10961

I found this by digging (since I'm not subscribed to linux-mmc), but it
would've been much more efficient if you Cc the original lists where the
issue was reported, and especially the person reporting the bug so it
can be tested by those reporting the problem.

I tested the above patch and verified it gets rid of all the noise in
the OMAP HS-MMC driver.

Chris, I see this is already in mmc-next.  Feel free to add:

Tested-by: Kevin Hilman <khilman@ti.com>

If you like.

Thanks,

Kevin
