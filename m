I looked at the sdhci_request_done() function and found that almost all
of it is executed inside of a 'spin_lock_irqsave()', including the potentially
expensive dma_sync_single_for_cpu() calls.

This means there is very little benefit in using the tasklet in the first place,
it could just as well run in the hwirq context that triggered it.

The part that is actually run with interrupts enabled in the tasklet
is mmc_blk_cqe_req_done(), but other drivers also call this from
IRQ context.
