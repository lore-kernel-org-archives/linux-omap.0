one of the quirks is that TI decided to registers into one (because they
both had 16-bits reserved, so, well, we can make the HW 0.0000000000001
dollar cheaper :-p )

The other is related where our SDHCI registers start. Because of TI's
added registers (SYSConfig and REVISION, etc), SDHCI registers have an
offset which generic SDHCI driver, doesn't cope with right now.

if you do change to ARCH_OMAP2PLUS, please also add COMPILE_TEST
(ARCH_OMAP2PLUS || COMPILE_TEST) so we can build in other archs.
