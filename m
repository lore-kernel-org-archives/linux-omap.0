I'm a bit of a fly on the wall here, but I'm curious how this impacts suspend/resume.
device_initialize->device_pm_init are called from device_register, so certainly this
patch doesn't also ensure that the PM ordering matches probe ordering, which is bound
to break suspend, right? Was this ever tested with the OMAP target? Shouldn't the
PM change be also part of this patch set? I don't see why you would want to have this in
without the PM changes.

Maybe I have it all wrong though :-).
