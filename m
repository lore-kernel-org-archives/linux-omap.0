Kishon, while testing I noticed there are still at least two
issues remaining that seem to need fixing in the MMC driver:

1. The legacy booting without device tree does not probe MMC at
   all on omap3

2. I'm getting the regulator warning on omap4 duovero

Anyways, I'm sending a pull request for the fixes so far as that
gets MMC working again for most platforms.

Regards,

Tony
