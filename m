Hi Andreas,


Thanks for testing out these patches.

Reproducing this hang is not straight forward. It takes 40-50 card
insertion/removal to see this case (sometimes even 100 tries).

I tried using omap_hsmmc_init initially, but here is the problem:

card inserted --> cd_irq_isr--> schedule mmc_rescan()
--- after some time ---
mmc_rescan() -->
mmc_sd_alive() -->
-- card removed ---
mmc_send_status -->
mmc_wait_for_req()-->
wait_for_completion()
^^^ Here the mmc_rescan thread waits forever because, it doesn't get
timeout interrupt for the cmd/req it sent (because card was removed).

But calls to omap_hsmmc_card_init or omap_hsmmc_get_cd are in the same
mmc_rescan thread. Hence, moving the recovery code to init_card does not
help.

I did try to find generic code in mmc-core, but couldn't find any.
However, I did see some driver specific cleanups related to unexpected
card removal in sdhci.c. sdhci handles this in .card_event call back.
This does not help in my case as .card_event  is also called from
mmc_rescan. I think cleanup code (in sdhci driver) for unexpected card
removal was introduced when .card_event call was outside mmc_rescan.

mmc_of_parse parses the cd-gpios and registers a generic cd_irq_isr but
there is no way to set driver specific cd_irq. So, the above code is
required.
