Chris,
   Here are a group of fixes posted by Felipe and Balaji for the
OMAP hsmmc driver in the past few days. 
   I've rebased them to the lastest mmc-next and posted them
here again. These have also been tested on OMAP4 development platform.

Please feel to apply directly or pull if that's convenient.
