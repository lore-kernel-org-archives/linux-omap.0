I'll try to explain the changes that went in MMC driver, PBIAS regulator
driver and devicetree.

******
MMC controller in OMAP platforms uses PBIAS to know when the voltage to
the IO lines are stable. So PBIAS regulator device tree node was added
(as a child node of ocp), CONFIG_PBIAS_REGULATOR was added to
omap2plus_defconfig and code to get and enable pbias regulator was added
in MMC driver. But then error checking in MMC driver wasn't correct. It
was something like this

        reg = devm_regulator_get_optional(host->dev, "pbias");
        host->pbias = IS_ERR(reg) ? NULL : reg;

For *any* errors it just sets pbias to NULL and proceeds normally.

With this code the behavior is same if CONFIG_PBIAS_REGULATOR is either
set or unset. The behavior is same if pbias driver gets probed properly
or not.

******
Then certain modifications were done in devicetree in order to correctly
model users of syscon registers. With this pbias regulator device tree
node was made as child node of scm_conf node.

This resulted in pbias device not being created (fixed by [1]), probe of
pbias regulator driver fails while doing platform_get_resource (fixed by
[2]) and pbias regulator enable was failing (fixed by [3])

[1] -> https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/27/391
[2] -> https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/9/4/210
[3] -> https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/9/4/205

But even without any of these fixes MMC continued to work because error
checking in MMC driver was not proper.

******
Along with PBIAS fixes, patches were sent to clean-up and fix MMC [4].
With this series MMC fails on real failures like if "pbias-supply"
property is populated in MMC dt node, then MMC driver will fail if it
doesn't get the pbias regulator (which means now if
CONFIG_PBIAS_REGULATOR is not enabled, MMC driver will fail if it finds
pbias-supply property in devicetree node). Since omap2plus_defconfig
already had CONFIG_PBIAS_REGULATOR, it was added for multi_v7_defconfig [5].

However not adding this detail in *Documentation* resulted in MMC
failures and $subject.

No, we didn't break old DT files. We added new compatible string to
handle newer DT [6]
