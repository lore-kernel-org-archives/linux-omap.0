Actually, the patch you talked to me about was v3 of this. It seems
that you have reposted v6 but labelled it v3. This is very confusing.

This is really the root of this problem. If you sit on code out of
tree for a year, and something breaks that we couldn't even have
detected since we didn't have the out-of-tree pieces. We'll help you
the first few times (such as now) but we will eventually stop caring.

If I was in a worse mood, then I'd just say that since your users
already has to have out-of-tree code to even use this functionality,
they could just add this fix on top of that stack of patches. But I'm
in a slightly better mood than that and I'll pick it up this time. :)

So that we can learn for next time: What should we (as in us
maintainers and you TI) have done differently to avoid this?
