Except for the excessively verbose comments which are just duplicating the code,

I'm ok with this patch as well. I'm putting a few patches under test
including this one,
and will send it to Chris as part of that series.
I'll strip out the above mentioned comments, unless there are any objections.

Thanks,
Venkat.
