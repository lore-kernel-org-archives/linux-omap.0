OK, that's good news, at least it was already reviewed by Mark.

I'm fixing and pulling the series, and will add Mark's Acked-by as soon 
as he will send it.

Meanwhile some nits, I'm fixing myself this time :-)

None of your subjects is following the same guideline and the repertory 
guideline...

   omap4: dts: Add node for AES
   omap4: dts: Add node for DES3DES module
   am33xx: dts: Fix AES interrupt number
   ARM: am437x: dts: Add AES node for am437x
   ARM: am437x: dts: Add DES node for am437x

It should be ARM: dts: OMAPXXX or AMXXX...

Regards,
Benoit
