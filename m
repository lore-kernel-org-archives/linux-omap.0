I think we are talking about the same thing. Let's for now discuss
having just 1 linked set to avoid confusion, that's fine.

I think where we are differing in our understanding, is the dummy link
comes into picture only when we are transferring the *last* SG.
For all others there is a cyclic link between P1 and P2. Would you agree?

Even in your diagrams you are actually showing such a cyclic link

Comparing this..

.. with this. Notice that P2 -> P1 became P1 -> P2

The next thing logical diagram would look like:

"P1 gets copied" happens only because of the cyclic link from P2 to P1,
it wouldn't have happened if P2 was linked to Dummy as you described.

Now coming to 2 linked sets vs 1, I meant the same thing that to give
interrupt handler more time, we could have something like:

>>>>> As part of TC completion interrupt handling:
>>>>>
>>>>> SG1 -> SG2 -> SG3 -> SG4 -> SG5 -> NULL
>>>>>  ^      ^             ^
>>>>>  |      |             |
>>>>> P0  -> P1  -> P2  -> P3  -> P4  ->  Null

So what I was describing as 2 sets of linked sets is P1 and P2 being 1
set, and P3 and P4 being another set. We would then recycle a complete
set at the same time. That way interrupt handler could do more at once
and get more time to recycle. So we would setup TC interrupts only for
P2 and P4 in the above diagrams.
