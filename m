I think we should not introduce the mask parameter at all. In the rare
case that we actually need to pass a mask other than DMA_SLAVE today,
we should be able to encode that in the data we pass to the filter
function.

However, a lot of drivers definitely need to pass a data pointer for
each device. I see that you currently rely on the IORESOURCE_DMA
method that a couple of platforms use today, but I think it would
be backwards to do it that way for the platforms that require passing
more than an integer number today.

Having a pointer as the filter function argument is intentional and I'd
prefer to change the platforms that currently use IORESOURCE_DMA (davinci,
pxa, omap1, blackfin, alchemy) to stop doing it instead, and return
IORESOURCE_DMA to its original meaning that was limited to ISAPNP style
devices not using the dmaengine API.
