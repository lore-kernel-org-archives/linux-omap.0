This one fails to build:

   CC      drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.o
drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.c: In function 'omap_hsmmc_start_command': 

drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.c:791: warning: unused variable 'int_en_mask'

make[4]: *** [drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.o] Error 1

Moving the 'out' label where I believe it should live I get:

I've "applied" the patch almost the same way you did and I was not able to get 
any further than the point above (command 0x0003 timed out). As far as I 
understand, what we have now is that omap_hsmmc_request_done() calls 
omap_hsmmc_disable_irq() and the interrupts that come from the 8686 _between_ 
requests are simply missed. Whatever I've tried to keep the SDIO interrupts on 
didn't help... :(
