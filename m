And, when the periodic wakeups are faster than the refresh time of powertop, no, powertop won't help you find the crapplication.   If you think that's acceptable, fine --- we'll see who wins in the marketplace, and who gets blamed for producing a crappy platform --- the incompetent application programmer, or the platform supplier.

Those apps were from an experimental repository, which is not enabled by 
default in stock SW.

Of course tools can be improved, but if someone decides to run sw which 
is clearly under heavy development, i see little point in complaining 
that it might not work as expected.
