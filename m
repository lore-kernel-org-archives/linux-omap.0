OK, I'm not terribly familiar with the crypto API, so I was assuming
that the init/exit calls you're instrumenting were happening at driver
probe/remove time.  Based on your clarifications, that doesn't seem to
be the case.

My main concern is that drivers don't simply use 'get' on driver probe
and 'put' on driver remove and force the system awake as long as the
driver is present.  I've seen that plenty of times, and I was assuming
that's what was going on here.  Sorry for the confusion.

Probably not needed.  

How about just add a few more details to the changelog summarizing
how/when the init/exit calls happen to make it a bit more clear.

Thanks,

Kevin
