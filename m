No at ramfs was used to validate this and was loaded via ethernet in U-boot.

Looking at the code the "ifdefCONFIG_REGULATOR" and the usage of use_reg
(use regulator) shows that this driver is suppose to support boards that
don't have the regulator framework enabled.

This patches insures that this driver can work without the regulator framework
which is currently broken.
