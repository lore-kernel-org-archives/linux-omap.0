As I say, I didn't see much of the code, only parts which looked
similar a voltage level-shifter.

The difference between fixed and gpio regulators, is that the former
is exactly that, 'fixed'. You can turn voltage on and off using a gpio
pin, but you can't shift the voltage. Something which is required of
your use-case. The latter switches between voltgages via a set of gpio
pins, for instance, your use-case could look somelike like:

static struct gpio_regulator_state sdi0_reg_states[] =3D {
        { .value =3D 3300000, .gpios =3D (1 << 0) },
        { .value =3D 1800000, .gpios =3D (0 << 0) },
};

But if there aren't any gpio pins involved, then this isn't what you
want either.
