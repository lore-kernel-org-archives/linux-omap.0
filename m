[Ghorai] Thanks and would you please reply for query from Kishore and now query from my side too?
Is there any use case or a valid scenario when to use omap_hsmmc_ps_ops or omap_hsmmc_ops ? I meant using power_saving option and without power_saving option.

Ideally I feel having omap_hsmmc_ps_ops as default with or without CONFIG_PM would be better as it internally has a state handling.

Regards,
Ghorai
