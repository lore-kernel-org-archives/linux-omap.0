This was a long message and I haven't absorbed the whole thing.  
However it's worth pointing out right at the start that we already have
device_pm_move_before(), device_pm_move_after(), and
device_pm_move_last().  They are intended specifically to provide
drivers with a way of making sure that dpm_list is in the right order 
-- people have been aware of these issues for some time.
