Dumb question: if the timers needed are on the order of minutes, why do
you need to use high-resolution timers?  I'm guessing the normal
kernel-internal timers should suffice here (see <linux/timer.h,
init_timer().)

Also, if they're on the order of minutes, I assume the actual firing
doesn't have to be precise, so deferrable timers can probably be used
(and thus help PM by coalescing wakeup events.) 

If my assumptions are true, it might be worth considering using the
normal timers, and use init_timer_deferrable().
