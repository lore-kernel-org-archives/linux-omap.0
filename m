Sure, not exactly a one-line but maybe couple of lines (see below). Also wasn't
referring to anything you're maintaining. I was just continuing the original
discussion of where we can improve as a community.

My point was very trivial changes that keep things working such as this one
should be merged in time to keep things working:
http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1210.2/01476.html

That one patch was reworked several times, and then was decided to do the right
way and finally merged with the limit-less series. All I am saying is all this
while the above patch(es) could be merged to keep things alive, and that way we
could avoid a lot of the pain and frustration that folks felt.

Its just my opinion though, I don't feel strongly about it but I think this may
be a helpful approach that's all.
