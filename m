AFAIR, 2 instances contain a DMA engine, but that should anyway be 
detected using a "ti,had-dma-engine" extra property and not like that.

Checking the code in #2, it is used to get the instance of the MMC.

+static unsigned int of_get_hsmmc_instance(struct device_node *np)
+{
+	int i;
+	char comp[32];
+
+	for (; i < OMAP_MMC_DEV_MAX; i++) {
+		snprintf(comp, 32, "ti,omap-hsmmc%d", i);
+		if (of_device_is_compatible(np, comp))
+			break;
+	}
+	return i;
+}

Which does not seems to be a good usage of the compatible property anyway.
For a similar issue someone on the list suggested using the "cell-index" 
property. But the definition I found in some binding documentation seems 
to reserve that to: "enumerate logical devices within an IP core."
Ideally the driver should probably get rid of the need for an index.
I didn't check the original driver, but that should be needed for some 
legacy reason.

Why did you think that?

That binding was pretty straightforward and mandatory for starting any 
OMAP device tree migration until we have the proper reg-names, irq-names 
and dma-names generic binding.

Did you had any concern with that binding?
