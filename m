Sorry it got delayed, I was planning to send it at -rc1 time but
had a pending pull request for fixes that got delayed, and it's
too late now until next merge window.

Seems that the missing one is safe to apply now? If so, let me just
take a look at that since I do have a branch already set up that
I can use.

Also, I was offline last week so I'll first have to check for any
pending fixes that might need attention.
