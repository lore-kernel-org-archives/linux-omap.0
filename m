Essentially, a lot of cleanups leading up to adding a new
feature for OMAP HSMMC. The idea is to convert to the use
of software timer instead of IP timer for timekeeping, due
to the limitations of the counting range of the IP timer.

Also added myself as OMAP HSMMC maintainer.

Patch 9/10 is in draft state and needs more testing.
