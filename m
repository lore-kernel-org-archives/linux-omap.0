Sometimes, a error occurs just after the Command has been reported
to be successful (CC=1) but before data transfer completes (TC=1).
Setting end_cmd=1 here leads to a NULL pointer dereference of
host->cmd as the command complete has previously been handled.

Set end_cmd only when command complete has not been handled
before, else a NULL pointer dereference occurs.
