The OMAP MMC and OMAP High Speed MMC hosts now use entirely the DMA
engine API instead of the previous private DMA API implementation.

So, if the kernel is built with support for any of these hosts but it
doesn't support DMA devices nor OMAP DMA support, it fails when trying
to obtain a DMA channel which leads to the following error on an OMAP3
IGEPv2 Rev.C board (and probably on most OMAP boards with MMC support):

[    2.199981] omap_hsmmc omap_hsmmc.1: unable to obtain RX DMA engine channel 48
[    2.215087] omap_hsmmc omap_hsmmc.0: unable to obtain RX DMA engine channel 62

selecting automatically CONFIG_DMADEVICES and CONFIG_DMA_OMAP solves it.

While being there, also update drivers/spi/spi-omap2-mcspi which has been
ported to DMA engine API too.

Changes since v1:

- Also include drivers/spi/spi-omap2-mcspi.c as suggested by Santosh Shilimkar.
