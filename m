no, actually I don't. I think this is a hack that intrudes into the
area it completely doesn't belong to.

In fact, one can have 2 views on this problem: either this is a fairly
generic problem we need to address, or this is a very specific corner
case.
Your solution will be treated as a hack in both cases.

If we consider it a generic problem, then we need to find a generic
solution, which is the board_info solution, for instance. FWIW, I2C
also uses this approach now.

If we consider it to be a corner case, let's just add a dummy
platform_device like it's done in WL1251 implementation and keep the
MMC subsystem clean.

Thanks,
   Vitaly
