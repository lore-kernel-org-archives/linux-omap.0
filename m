Is'nt the better definition to state i have quirk X and allow the
driver to do the necessary thing/things needed to handle quirk X? in
this case, there is just one thing to do: broken multi_block_read, in
the case of other quirks, there might be more than 1 thing to do.. let
driver figure that out, dts just states the h/w capabilty or in this
case, the quirk capability.
