Alright, let's start with this.  That also means that the current
probe deferral patch doesn't need to have any knowledge of dpm_list
added to it.  It will be required only of the users.

I'd still like to look closely at the ordering of dpm_list for the
non-deferred use case, but that can be an entirely separate patch set.
 It doesn't need to block the probe deferral work.
