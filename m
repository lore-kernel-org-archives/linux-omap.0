With 0925, i think the patches got merged. here is my testing status on
the boards I have access to:

https://github.com/nmenon/kernel-test-logs/tree/next-20150925

Looks like with omap2plus_defconfig, at least
https://github.com/nmenon/kernel-test-logs/blob/next-20150925/omap2plus_defconfig/am335x-evm.txt
somethign is broken there - dunno what yet.

There are a few more farm related failures in various locations, but not
too interesting.
