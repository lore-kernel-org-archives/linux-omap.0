I have:

I2C-Bus-A
   +--Mux-I2C (controlled by parent I2C-Bus-A)
       +---I2C-Bus-1
       |      +--GPIO-Expander-A
       |
       +---I2C-Bus-2
              +--GPIO-Expander-B

These all have a parent/child relationship so no deferral is needed, so 
far so good.


Then this:

MDIO-Bus-A
    +---Mux-MDIO (controlled by GPIO-Expander-A)
          +---MDIO-Bus-1
          |
          +---MDIO-Bus-2
                +---PHY-1
                |
                +---PHY-2

In this case the driver for Mux-MDIO needs to be deferred until *both* 
MDIO-Bus-A's driver *and* GPIO-Expander-B's driver are loaded.  A 
perfect use case for the patch.

Would you consider Mux-MDIO to be a 'leaf device'?  If not, then I have 
real problems with 'the limitation that only leaf devices can take 
advantage of probe deferral'
