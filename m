Yeah. 32k clock is not provided by twl.

As I said I need to take a look at CCF to see if it already there. If i=
t is
clock driver + mapping + patch for wl12xx should fix the issue you are =
facing.

BTW: have you happened to ubdate u-boot recently? There is a nice easte=
r egg
added there:
f3f98bb ARM: OMAP4/5: Do not configure non essential pads, clocks, dpll=
s.

Which means that _essential_ clocks and pads are no longer configured.
