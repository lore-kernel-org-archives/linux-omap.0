Good point, I don't know. :) Probably Eliad has the answer for that.

In any case, I don't see why this behaviour should be different in the
different board files.  If there is the problem of power consumption
while in suspend, we will have it also with the 4430sdp board.

I'm not sure about doing it dynamically, though.  I think it would be
more of a kernel configuration option or something.  At least the board
file is not the correct place to decide whether the wl12xx chip will
support WoW or not.  And, if we change only the MMC capabilities of the
wl12xx chip, we won't hurt other scenarios, when the wl12xx chip is not
in use.
