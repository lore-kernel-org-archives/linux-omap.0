Hi,

Certainly seems way less intrusive than earlier before the
dmaengine changes :)

Hmm what's the tuning ratio?

I gave this a quick try after manally applying next-20170519
after reverting 67d0687224a9 ("mm: drop HASH_ADAPT"). Looks like
something is missing as I got:

arch/arm/mach-omap2/pdata-quirks.c:445:23: error:
'struct omap_hsmmc_platform_data' has no member named 'version'
...

It's possible I messed up something while manually applying.

Yes please. Maybe send the dts parts first that are ready to
get merged, like the fixes and all the iodelay configuration.

Then the mmc driver changes as a separate set.

Then third set to follow-up and enable things once the mmc
driver changes are merged.

Regards,

Tony
