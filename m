Lossy was perhaps not the best choice of words, non-continuous would be 
a better choice in the uplink case. To adjust timing, some samples from 
the continuous locally recorded PCM stream need to be skipped and/or 
duplicated. This would normally be done between speech bursts to avoid 
artifacts.

Yes, we need flags that tell about the frame. Please see docs for 
'frame_flags' and 'spc_flags' in libcmtspeechdata cmtspeech.h:
https://www.gitorious.org/libcmtspeechdata/libcmtspeechdata/source/9206835ea3c96815840a80ccba9eaeb16ff7e294:cmtspeech.h

Kernel space does not have enough info to handle these flags as the audio 
mixer is not implemented in kernel, so they have to be passed to/from 
user-space.

And some further info in libcmtspeechdata/docs/ 
https://www.gitorious.org/libcmtspeechdata/libcmtspeechdata/source/9206835ea3c96815840a80ccba9eaeb16ff7e294:doc/libcmtspeechdata_api_docs_main.txt

But how would you implement that via the ALSA API? With cmt_speech, a 
speech packet is prepared in a mmap'ed buffer, flags are set to describe 
the buffer, and at the correct time, write() is called to trigger 
transmission in HW (see cmtspeech_ul_buffer_release() in 
libcmtspeechdata() -> compare this to snd_pcm_mmap_commit() in ALSA). In 
ALSA, the mmap commit and PCM write variants just add data to the 
ringbuffer and update the appl pointer. Only initial start (and stop) on 
stream have the "do something now" semantics in ALSA.

The ALSA compressed offload API did not exist back when we were working on 
cmt_speech, but that's still not a good fit, although adds some of the 
concepts (notably frames).

See above, ALSA just doesn't work like that, there's no syscall for "send 
these samples now", the model is different.
