During system suspended patch, a callback named .prepare will be first done before .suspend is called, and .complete callback will be called after .resume is called. These two callbacks are in pair. If driver can implement the .prepare and hold the usage count in this callback, then runtime pm suspend/resume will not happen during device suspending. So there will be no need to add pm_runtime_get* and pm_runtime_put* in .suspend/.resume.
BTW, if .prepare has hold the usage count, then .complete callback need to release the usage count and put device in runtime suspended mode.
