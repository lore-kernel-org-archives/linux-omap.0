Hi,

Changes compared to v1 of the series:

- dropped first patch from the series (crypto: omap-aes: Fix registration of
  algorithms) as it was queued by Herbert already
- modified the second (now first) patch of the series to use runtime auto-
  suspend instead of getting static sync over a cra lifetime
- re-ordered the DTS / hwmod changes in the series, the merge order of
  these must be maintained to avoid issues

Patches #01 .. #14 should be merged via crypto tree, the rest should be
handled by Tony.

Merging the omap / dts parts can be done safely separately, assuming
you just use omap2plus_defconfig (enabling crypto features will
cause some issues without the driver level fixes.)

- Tero
