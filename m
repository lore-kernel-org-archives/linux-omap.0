I am not sure I get your point. Perhaps I was too vague in what I suggested.

Unless we express the dependencies via Kconfig files (or perhaps via
updated defconfigs), how do you expect build/boot automated tools to
handle this?

*People* can of course manually poll a README to learn about new
dependencies for each new kernel version, but me personally would
prefer if don't have to.

No thanks, it would sprinkle drivers with ugly code :-). I would also
expect that we would get warnings even when we shouldn't, especially
as a cross SoC/board driver may have different dependencies.

To me REGULATOR_PBIAS is a dependency required by a certain SoC/board
when MMC_OMAP_HS is selected. Isn't such dependency easiest dealt with
from SoC/board Kconfig files? Llike for example in the OMAP2 case,
arch/arm/mach-omap2/Kconfig.

Kind regards
