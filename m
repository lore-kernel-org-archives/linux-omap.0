I don't think it's a huge deal as adding new devices on board files is
anyway something that is done carefully and not so often. Btw, we have
this kind of mechanism in other locations of the kernel as well and it
doesn't seem to be problematic (e.g. spi->chip_select, spi->mode,
spi->irq, ...).

Having said that I don't mind applying your proposal either and
pushing those defines by 1 in the driver. Luca what do you think ?

Thanks,
Ohad.
