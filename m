NAK.  The MMC driver (or any other driver, for that matter) must not set 
MPU frequency constraints merely to boost performance.  Drivers have no 
way of knowing what the power vs. performance policy is for a given device 
or use case.

If the system is not upscaling MPU frequency quickly enough, then the 
power management policy code -- CPUFreq, in the MPU case -- or the 
parameters for that code -- need to be adjusted.  (Of course, integrators 
can always dump hacks like this in their own trees if they get lazy, but 
these should be kept far, far away from mainline.)

N.B.  As a separate matter, the MMC driver should call 
omap_pm_set_min_bus_tput() with the maximum throughput that the current 
MMC card can sustain to memory.  A reasonable upper bound should be easy 
to calculate based on the MMC clock speed and the width of the MMC 
transfers.  This will allow the kernel to adjust the bus frequency 
appropriately as the OMAP PM core's bus utilization model improves.
