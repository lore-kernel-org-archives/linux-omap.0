We prefer not to power up the chip as early as boot time; instead, we
would like to have it powered off until the wlan interface is brought
up, power it on when the interface is brought up,
and power it off again as soon as the interface is brought down again
(to minimize power consumption when the wlan is not in use).

=46or that we can't rely on the probing done when the controller is
registered, we want to have a mechanism to allow dynamic detection and
removal of the card.

Note: the wl1271 device does support standard card detection, but
AFAIK there's a limitation to use that with the specific omap
controller the device is hardwired to. I will try to get more info
about that, but probably Madhu can comment on that better.

Please check out the last patch - that patch is doing that configuratio=
n.
In essence, this virtual card detect mechanism is enabled only for
specific controllers which we know there's an embedded sdio device
hardwired to. This knowledge is board-specific, and that's why we
enable this mechanism in the board files, per a specific mmc
controller.

Thanks,
Ohad.
