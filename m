omap2_hsmmc_info is filled in respective board files and will have a ca=
ll to
omap2_hsmmc_init [hsmm.c].
In omap2_hsmmc_init, it will call omap_hwmod_for_each_by_class which
takes 3 arguments out of which 2nd one is a callback and 3rd one is voi=
d
pointer to be passed to call back if necessary.
With this the callback "omap_mmc_init" will be called multiple times ba=
sed on
the class entry in hwmod data file for each controller.
Say you have 3 controllers as in OMAP3, then "omap_mmc_init" will be
called thrice.
Here the argument "hsmmcinfo" needs to be  incremented for each call, s=
o having
a static mmc_num and incrementing it on each call.

The current implementation for initialization of MMC controllers will w=
ork
with any of the below  order of devices:
1) MMC1, MMC2, MMC3
2) MMC1, MMC3
3) MMC2, MMC1
4) MMC3, MMC2, MMC1
5) MMC3

Its because the 3rd argument in omap_hwmod_for_each_by_class is void * =
