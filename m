Wait, I just looked up the serial number on the board. The one I was using
is a pilot version where this problem exists.

I happen to get an other board which is production unit with ser # 1013089
Rev B. The eMMC on this board has no issue. It reports the EXT_CSD Rev 2
which is correct and works fine.

http://omappedia.org/wiki/Zoom_Resources

There is a table here which could help.

Tony, do you care to just look up the serial number of your board?

But again there are several boards out there which could have this
non-working eMMC. So what do we do?? It does not make sense to keep
something enabled which does not work.

Madhu
