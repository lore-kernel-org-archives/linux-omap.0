OK, we will not call this function but still need to call the callback. 
So do you suggest to call callback directly from dma driver rather than 
the virt_chan?

Here I am developing the dma driver for Tegra in cyclic and normal mode 
and what is your suggestion here?
Should I use your virt_chan now or I can go ahead with my first patch 
without virt_chan and once you are done with your virt_chan with all 
cyclic support then  port the tegra_dma to use virt chan and next 
enhanced patch?

In this way, my Tegra dma will be there in tree, all client will be move 
to dma engine based driver and then I will comeback to tegra_dma for 
using the virt_channel.
