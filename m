agreed, will get rid of instance number from the compatible property.

right, will do that.

Its used to derive the vdd range the card supports. I hadn't
looked at this closely, but looks like this isn't something that
needs to be told to the driver anyway, it can always just query the
card about the voltages it supports and derive the ocrmask internally.
One more of the hacks in the driver to be cleaned up. Will drop this
property completely.

You mean there is already a binding available for this?

Thanks for the review.
