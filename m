This is a new version which moves most of the code into
mmc/core so it is available to all drivers.

I was wrong about not being able to sleep in pm_runtime callbacks.
There are spinlocks, but not the ones I thought they were...

Anyway, I tried switching to 1-bit mode from within the
runtime_suspend callback and hit a different problem.
The sequence to switch to 1-bit involves calling set_ios
which, for omap_hsmmc at least, calls pm_runtime_get_sync().

Calling pm_runtime_get_sync from the runtime_suspend callback
deadlocks.

It would be possible to remove the pm_runtime_get_sync call
from set_ios() functions, and instead call host->enable(),
host->disable() around those mmc_set_ios() calls which don't
have the host claimed.  However that seems a bit fragile to me.

So for now I'm persisting with doing the width change from
a work-queue.  This set of patches does that.

If you think calling host->enable/disable around mmc_set_ios() calls
does make sense, I can post my other patch for review.

Thanks,
NeilBrown

      mmc: core: fold mmc_set_bus_width calls into sdio_enable_4bit_bus.
      mmc: core: allow non-blocking form of mmc_claim_host
      mmc: sdio: support switching to 1-bit before turning off clocks
      mmc: omap_hsmmc: switch to 1-bit before stopping clocks.
