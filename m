I want a distinct error code for probe deferral so that a) it doesn't
overlap with something a driver is already doing, and b) so that all
the users can be found again at a later date.

That said, I'm not in agreement with this patch.  It is fine for gpio
lib to have a code that means the pin doesn't exist (yet), but the
device driver needs to be the one to decide whether or not it is
appropriate to use probe deferral.
