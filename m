I would rather just leave this naming alone. The code is quite self
documenting: total_link_set means "Calculate what's the total size of a
Linkset, or total no.of slots in a linkset we need". This naming is fine
in my opinion and doesn't hurt line size at all, instead improving code
readability. I could dump the _ between link and set to make it:
total_linkset if that makes it any easier.

I agree there are too many variables in this function, but they each
serve a different purpose and required to implement the algorithm, which
is precisely I made them naming a bit more descriptive.

But how? That would only change the code to (?):

        if (edesc->total_processed == 0) {
		issue_pending();
	}

Further it maybe appear that this case is uncommon, but it is a very
common case. Most SG transfers are within the SG limit, though at times
the else case can execute a lot too.

Ok thanks, changed accordingly.

I tried to do this in a loop, its not possible without making the code
more unreadable and introducing more variables.

Further the follow 3 conditions have to be incorporated into the loop
some how which kind of makes it messy.. right now it is linearly
determined which case to execute.

/* Setup a link from linked set 1 to set 0 */

/* Setup a link between linked set 1 to dummy */

/* First linked set was enough, simply link to dummy */

Since it is just a couple of lines more, I am more to the favor of
keeping the code readable than saving a few lines (for a loop of only 2
iterations) introducing more variables and making it look hackish. There
is a good chance in future that if implemented in such a way that I have
to spend quite a bit of time deciphering it.

The above linking you're quoting is done in advance _but_, before the
link is traversed, it is _guaranteed_ that the linkset being traversed
into will be recycled. This is the basis of the whole algorithm and
making sure that we never stall. There never ever will be a case where
we re-DMA old data because of the guarantee that the recycling will take
place before the traversal.

Further FWIW, interrupt takes few 100s microseconds to execute, where as
DMA is seen to take milliseconds from 1 SG entry to another in my testing.

This goes back to my first patch series where we stall. That doesn't
make any sense. In this patch series, we don't want DMA to stall at any
cost.

Nope! Linking to dummy will absorb the events and the events will never
get triggered again. Trust me I have already done what you are saying
and it doesn't work.

Sure, thanks.
